            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And if it happily falls out, That any of a <hi>Lower Rank</hi> are Candid and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating, Impartial, and Disengadged, Modest, and Docil, as they do thereby rise above the common Level, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach those of a <hi>higher Sphere;</hi> So on the other hand, when one of a <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Gentile Original</hi> is found destitute of the mentioned <hi>Qualities</hi> he doth in so far <hi>Sink</hi> and decline towards the <hi>Dregs</hi> of the People; nothing being more <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble</hi> than a <hi>Mean</hi> and <hi>Indocil</hi> Spirit, a mind that is very <hi>Weak,</hi> and yet very <hi>Peremptory</hi> and Decissive in its Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that is so <hi>Limited</hi> and tyed up to a set off thoughts and Opinions that it becomes Uncapable of being better informed, and making free and Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inquities, and that imagines these Conceptions of things, which it hath

<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:104909:5"/> Thoughts. No doubt, one great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle that kept the Jews and Heathen Philosophers from acknowledging the <hi>Messias,</hi> and from Embraceing his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Doctrines, was their Stiff adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their former Apprehensions and prejudices, and Arrogantly presuming of the Truth of them. But this <hi>Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie</hi> is never more intolerable, and accompanied with more fatal Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, than when it is found in those, who, not contenting themselves with <hi>Pure and Simple Christianity,</hi> have mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied <hi>Articles of Faith</hi> to such Vast Numbers, that whole Volumes cannot contain them, and who, Tho in the Judgements of all thinking and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Persons, these Additional Articles are for the most part either very False, or Uncertain, or useless Speculations, yet obtrude them on the VVorld with such eagerness and Zeal, as if they were the very Marrow and Substance of our <hi>Holy Religion,</hi> and Persecute with a Fierce and Bloody Violence, and load
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:104909:6"/> with ill names, such as are of other thoughts in these lesser Matters; because they will not pay the same Regard to these impositions and inventions of Men, that they do to the most indisput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Maximes of the Gospel. This this hath been, and still is one great Source of these Lamentable Schisms and Animosities, these Divisions and Subdivisions that disturb and distract the Christian World, that sullie the Beauty of our Religion, and render both it and us a <hi>Scorn to our Neighbours, and a reproach to all that are round about us.</hi> 'Tis this that hath stiffled <hi>Charity,</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> brought forth a Spirit of Malice and Faction, of Blood and Persecution, and banished not only from the Hearts, but from the Memories of Men that Benignity and <hi>mutual Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> which the Gospel so frequently and so passionatly urges and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends. They are the <hi>Superadded Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> that the different <hi>Parties</hi> contend with, and persecute one another for,
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:104909:6"/> Now to be sure these cannot <hi>All</hi> be <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Points,</hi> that is, Truths on the Belief whereof Eternal Life depends, since at this Reckoning, the whole Christian World must be damned, for the several Parties of which it consists do reciprocally disbelieve, and even condemn for Errors and Heresies one another's distinguishing Articles. But in effect, so far are they from being of this Moment, that, very often, they are not only downright Triffles and <hi>Logomachies,</hi> but in many instances ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarly false; For since the particular Doctrines which distinguish Sects, are not only different from, but also contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to one another, It is impossible that Truth should be on all sides. Some must be infallibly mistaken; And seing the Matter stands thus, why should not we <hi>let our Moderation be known to all Men?</hi> Why should we not rather sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our selves, than rashly censure and judge others? Are not all of us lyable to Mistakes? Dare any lay claim to

                     <hi>Infallibility?</hi> Ought we not then to think soberly of our own Sentiments, and construe charitably of the Opinions of such as differ from us? Would it not be infinitly more our Advantage, to be pushing one another to the <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of the great and indispensable things of our Religion, than to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally wrangling about doubtful, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or unprofitable Speculations? Shall we forever exhaust the Vigour and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of our Spirits in Controversies and Debates, in things at a Vast distance from the Vitals of Piety, and in the mean time faintly pursue, and continue Strangers to Self-denyal, to the Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our Lusts and Passions, to the Imitation of Our Saviour, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World, to the Love of GOD and Man, to a Life of Faith, to the Operations and Influences of Divine Grace, in purifying and Regenerating our Souls?

                  <p>The Subject here treated of is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be of <hi>great Consequence,</hi> So that there is no Necessity, we should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to evince that it is so in this place, especially considering that something to that Purpose must be done else where in Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our design. Indeed, the matter speaks of it self, and all seem to be under some Sense of it, tho' I am afraid there are but few who lay it to Heart as they ought. I know that a great many excellent Persons, have written concerning the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of Youth,</hi> and communicated their Thoughts about it to the World, so that a new Attempt of this Nature may be thought superfluous. All I shall say as to this is, that the Subject seems not to be so exhausted, but that something either as to <hi>Matter or Method</hi> may yet be suggested that may merit Consideration. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not this be done in the Essays that follow, the <hi>Candid Reader</hi> hath Liberty to determine as he shall see Cause. Besides, since it is confessed that the Matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is of so high a Concern, and since it is also plain,
<pb n="III" facs="tcp:104909:20"/> that the great Duties which are owing to the Youth, such I mean as regard their Souls, are either wholly <hi>neglected,</hi> or but superficially <hi>performed,</hi> by the most, it were to be wished that <hi>Treatises</hi> of this <hi>Nature</hi> were more frequently in the hands of People, that by perusing them, they might be awakened into a deep Sense of the Obligations that ly on them upon this score, and directed how to discharge a Right so weighty and Important a Province, and that out of the Supposed Variety of this Sort of Books, they might fix on such of them as their Experience shall determine, to conduce most effectually to promove the Interests of a Christian Education. However I believe, that Treatises on this Subject are not so very numerous among us, but that the Publication of one may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to pass, without needing to complain that the Multitude is too much inreased thereby.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Design</hi> I proposed to my self, was to deliver the <hi>Measures of a Christian Education,</hi> and in Order to compass this
<pb n="IV" facs="tcp:104909:21"/> end, I have consulted as exactly as was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for me <hi>the Maximes of the Gospel.</hi> 'Tis out of these that I have fetched the <hi>Directions</hi> I have given; and they are so ordered, as that Parents and Others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the Care of Youth, cannot but be convinced, that an <hi>Attempt to Educat Christianly,</hi> necessarly presupposes and requires a <hi>Solid and Real Piety</hi> in those that manage that <hi>weighty Affair.</hi> We shall but in vain pretend to urge these great things on others, without that our own Hearts be in some measure affected with them, and our Lives regulated according to them. But this I have so often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and indeed the thing is so evident in it self, that I shall not need to insist here on it.</p>
                  <p>I have at the Entry noted somethings which I could not but look on as very great <hi>Faults</hi> in the way of managing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of Youth, perhaps towards the last of them<note n="a" place="margin">Essay 1. p. 32.</note> I have let fall some passages that may a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige the <hi>Admirers</hi> of the <hi>Belles

In short, I make no scruple to Determine, that they who peruse the Pagan Writtings without being

In the mean time, as to this Particular, I desire the following remarks (of the truth of which all that are Candid will be easily sensible) may be duly considered. 1. That as the design

When the Children have fulfilled the years of their attendance at these Schools, and Colledges, that which the Parents do most solicitously enquire after, is not, what advances they have made
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104909:39"/> in the Theory and practice of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, but what speed they have come in Humane Learning, and if they can have satisfaction, as to the latter, I doubt if they will be much troubled in any defects that may be in their Children as to the former. And since the matter is thus in effect; How the pretence of sending Children to Schools and Colledges, will excuse negligent and unconscientious Parents in the sight of GOD, I am not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</p>
                     <p>Next as to Ministers of Religion, It is acknowledged that it is their indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensible duty, very particularly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themselves with the Pious Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Children, and that not only in exhorting Parents to diligence in this great work, and taking care that they seriously set about it, but also travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in it themselves, as much and as often as possibly they can; Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that if they be negligent herein, their great Master, (who in the days of His Converse on earth,<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 19.14. Suffer little Children to come unto Me, and forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.</note> was so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry concerned about the Salvation of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104909:40"/> Young Ones will severely account with them for it; But in the mean time, let it be considered that the duty of the Pastor doth not supersede the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Parent, both ought to joyn and concurr in this most important work and all the endeavours that both can contribute, will be but little enough to carry it on.</p>
                     <p>If it be further urged that Parents are at great expences to keep their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>chools, and that they pay large Stipends to Ministers, of purpose for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them to travel in the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their Children, and that therefore it is but reasonable, that they (the Parents) be exempted from the trouble, and cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>quently, that the blame of their ill Education must not ly at the door of the Parents, but of those whose particular functions oblige them them to superintend it. It is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that as Ministers and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structers of Youth, are obliged with all possible care and faithfulness to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their dutys in Advancing this most weighty concern, so the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are obliged to discharge theirs. It is doubtles the joynt work of both, none
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104909:40"/> of them must decline their share in it, &amp; the more hands employed about it, the better success it is like to have. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it seems very evident, that GOD hath devolved the greatest Stress of this Province, on the Parents themselves, and it is infinitly reasonable he should do so, Considering the very many and great Advantages which they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others for their Childrens good. And if you desire to know, what these advantages are, a Judicious Author will inform<note place="margin">Chr: Dir. part 2. page 38</note> you.</p>
                     <p>But because the passage is full and pertinent, and since the Book where it is, being voluminous, is not readily in the hands of all those whom these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections may concern, I shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my self with a simple referrence to it; But for the common benefit of Parents transcribe it at large; <q>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104909:41"/> but of their Parents love they make no doubt. <hi>2.</hi> And their love to you is as great a Preparative to your Success. We all hearken to them whom we dearly love, with greater attention and willingness then to others. They love not the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters as they do their Parents. <hi>3.</hi> You have them in hands betimes, before they have received any false Opinions, or bad Impressions, before they have any sin, but that which was born with them: You are to make the first Impressions on them: You have them while they are most Tractable, and Flexible, &amp; Tender; &amp; make least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance against Instruction: They rise not up at first against your Teaching with self conceitedness and proud objections. But when they come to the Minister, they are as Paper that is Written on, or Printed before, unapt to receive another Impression: They have much to be untaught before they can be taught, and come with proud and stiff resistance, to strive against Instruction, rather then readily to receive it. <hi>4.</hi> Your Children do wholy depend on you for their present Maintenance, and much for their future Livelyhood and Portion; And therefore they know that it is their Interest to obey and please you; And
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104909:41"/> as Interest is the common byass of the World, so it is with your Children, you may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rule them that have this handle to hold them by, then any other can do that have not this advantage. They know they serve you not for nought. <hi>5.</hi> Your Authority over your Children, is most unquestionable, they will dispute the Authority of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, yea, and of Magistrates, and ask them, who gave them the power to teach them, and to command them? But the Parents Authority is beyond all dispute. They will not call you Tyrants, or Ʋsurpers, nor bid you prove the validitie of your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, or the Ʋninterruptedness of your Succession. Therefore Father and Mother as the first Natural Power are mentioned, rather then Kings or Queens in the fifth Commandment. <hi>6.</hi> You have the power of the Rod to force them, <hi>Prov: 22.15.

You can quicken their Attention by Questions, which put them upon Answering you, and so awaken them to a serious regard of what you say. <hi>10.</hi> You are so frequently with them, that you can repeat your instructions, and drive them home, that what is not done at one time, may be done at another: Whereas other Men can seldome speak to them, and what is so seldom done, is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So that whatever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious tinctures they may receive, by means of this partial education, they are but slight and superficial, and of no value, being consistent with dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions and practices, directly opposit to the Spirit of Christianity.

These are the <hi>Diana's</hi> that must be adorned, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, defended, and vindicated, while the most important and most necessary Truths and Duties are sadly neglected; For daily experience puts it beyond dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, that Men are more foreward and hot in advancing these Opinions and Practices that are peculiar to their way, then in advancing these things that are unquestionably the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Religion; Nay it often comes to pass that the later is sacrificed in fav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of the former: Which obliges me to add; 4. That by this Conduct,

This is it that would justify the regrates for want of Children; and I am apt to think that a regard to this Divine Aim, was one reason at least, why many good Souls of old, did so passionatly bewaile their Barrenness; that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not so happy as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the number of those that love and praise, and enjoy GOD; certainly, were Children procreate with this prospect, the remembrance of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aim that influenced the begetting of them, would oblige Parents to use all possible endeavours, that they might not fall short of it. But when the pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of lust, and the inordinate inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of corrupt nature, is the only principle that acts men; it is no wonder though the education of Children be suitable to it, that is, carnal and sensual,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104909:56"/> in the mean time, if they who have entred on the married state, and are Parents, shall find that they have been defective in this (as it is to be feared, there are few but will) it is absolutely fit, that they resume this noble aim: Or if they be such as are past the hopes of having any more Children, let them make the best mends they can, by pious cares, and a doubled diligence, to bring up those they have already, with a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reguard to the Aim so often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; that though they have not been influenced by it in the Generation, yet they may be in the Education of their children. I know the prophane and sensual World, will be ready enough to laugh at this; For so dissolute and vain are Men become, that nothing (though never so serious) can be said of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Married State, but it must be presently turned into matter of sport, and entertainment; But it is to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious I am Writing, and these, I know, will be well pleased to be taught their Duty.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104909:61"/> the Parents must pray for their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and ammendment; and if they see any hopeful beginnings of good in them, They must pray for the increase, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and perseverance of it; if they are afflicted, and in trouble, they must pray, not so much for their deliverance, as for grace to bear them <hi>patiently,</hi> and that they may tend to their Spiritual advantage. And when they engage in any Calling, they are to pray, that they may be enabled to serve GOD in it, and to be useful instruments to advance the honour of Religion, and the good of Mankind. and to be sure, these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, when they come from sincere and ingenuous hearts, will not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded: For infinite goodness will not fail to reward them, and communicate light and grace unto, and increase them in, both themselves and their Off-Spring: So that they may on good grounds, hope that their young ones will be sanctified from the womb.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104909:64"/> capable of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the Diviner Faculties, but in this state of Degeneracy and corruption, wherein all things are perverted and out of order, and wherein the Diviner Faculties are fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep; It is necessary that we make our way into them by the other Faculties.</p>

                     <p>But great care must be taken, that we do not teach Young Ones to Exercise their lower Faculties meerly for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, so as finally to rest in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of them, as if the perfection of our Souls did consist in their improvement without respect to the Nobler Faculties, For this were to teach them to seek their Happiness in themselves, and in the Exercise and Activity of their own Faculties, in a neglect of GOD, of his Light and Joy. But our Duty is, by the Exercise of their lower faculties, ro lead them to the Imploying of the Divine Ones, and to teach them to direct their <hi>Desires</hi> to GOD, that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely satiating Object, to offer up their <hi>Ʋnderstanding</hi> to be Illuminated by his Divine Light, and to <hi>Aequiesee</hi> and Rest, and delight themselves in the solacing presence of his Felicities and Love; And a Conscientious and expert Instructer of Young Ones will be quickly sensible, that these Divine Faculties are capable of a very early Exercise; And may by the Pious Diligence of Parents, and the Divine Grace accompanying, be awakned and excited, as soon as ever the lower Faculties begin to appear, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104909:65"/> can be exercised, as might be made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by many Instances of Young Ones, who, some in the Eight, some in the seventh, some in the sixth, some in the fifth, yea, and some in the 4th. and third year of their Age, had great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires after, and wonderful discoveries and Tastes of GOD.</p>
                     <p>But I think, it will not be unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able here to injoyn Parents, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Instructers of Young Ones, that they seriously tell them, of what Value and Import all these Ideas and Notions of Divine Things are, which they have either by the Exercise of their Reason, or by the information of others.

That all these Notices or Ideas of Divine
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104909:65"/> and Spiritual things, which we have in our minds, either by means of our reason, or by the instruction of others, are not the things themselves, but the faint and shaddowie, the dead and Barren Pictures, or Images of them, which do no wayes iluminate, satiate, and enrich the Soul, nor fill it with that which is truely and solidly good. But rather, (if we do not turn our faculties from these Airie Images unto the things themselves, that is, unto GOD, who is the only Source and Dispensor of all lights, and of these things that are truely Substantial, seeking and expecting from him the realitie, and substance of his own things) we shall, if we obstinately adhere to our own notions and ideas, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of our corrupted Reason about them, become by this means both worse, for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make our recourse to the living, &amp; the liberal foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

The other thing to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate on them, is, that our ideas and notions of Divine things, considered in their own element or Nature, that is, as they are separated and distinguished from the things themselves, and regarded as shaddowie Pictures, (such a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And these imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Ideas, are such as cannot be redressed, but by Divine Aids (which by our Prayers we are instantly to call for) and by the assistance of those, in whom these things are more rectified, then in our selves.</p>
                     <p>By the help of these two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, if they be not neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they who study their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise &amp; improvement of their Reason, shall reap these Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, namely that they shall not be puffed up by means of the Ideas and notions of things

Thus instead of a proud, obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, cold and irreligious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to their own Opinions and Judgements, which are the Epidemick Vices of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104909:67"/> learned Men of the World, grown up with them from their verie Childhood, the Youth shall acquire together with the culture and increase of their Reason, an humble and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mind and temper, and beautified with undisguised and ingenuous Pietie, which as<note n="*" place="margin">

But there is a <hi>Soul</hi> and a <hi>Spirit</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths that could never be congealed into ink, that could never be blotted upon Paper, which by a secret tradition and conveyance passeth from one Soul into a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nother, being able to dwell or lodge no where but in a Spiritual being in a living thing, because it self is nothing else but

The life of Divine truths is better expressed in actions than in words, because actions are more living things than words. Words are nothing but dead Resemblances and Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of those Truths, which live and breath in actions.

To be very thankful for the measures of Grace alreadie received: But yet not to rest satisfied with what they have attained, as if there were no more behind, or as if they had enough, and were not capable, or did not stand in need of any more, but to be still thirsting after, and desiring fuller Communications of these Living Influences, until in end they be filled <hi>with all the fulness of GOD.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4ly.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104909:75"/> enemies to their Salvation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently it is their Duty never to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge, countenance, or cherish them; never to keep any secret Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, much less to joyn issue with them; but being now lifted under the Redeemer, end assisted by His Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Grace, to renounce and abandon, to resist and oppose them with vigor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie and Resolution, as the declared Enemies of their GOD, and their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.

The World with all its pomps, and Vanities, and Pleasures and sinfull customs. This is the mighty engine the Devil makes use of to seduce those, that have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the service of the Holy JESUS,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104909:75"/> into disloyaltie against their great LORD and Master, and basely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert his Standard; And therefore they must for ever renounce and despise the World with all its wicked factions and entising Gayeties, the gaudie splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of Riches, and all the magnificence which ministers to pride and vanity. They must not desire them greedily, nor delight in them at all, nor use them so as to make them forget GOD, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the solid Glories of a better World. 3. The flesh, that is, corrupt Nature with all its lusts and appetits, inclinations and desires. This is a bosome enemie, and consequently the more dangerous; It is by means of it, that the outward ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie gets access into the Soul; And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently it must be carefully guarded against, and not only so, but its utter ruine and extirpation constantly and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously endeavoured; It must be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, killed and destroyed. And when once the Victorie is gain'd over this inward enemie, the attempts of the outward will be soon defeated, and the conquest over them easily obtained.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When Parents have thus represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto their Children the <hi>Baptismal
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104909:76"/> Covenant,</hi> and the great and necessarie Dutys, to which it indispensably obleiges them, their next work is to gain <hi>their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and personal consent to what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in their name,</hi> and to engage them to the practice of the Duty from the consideration of their <hi>Baptismal Vows.</hi> They are to tell them, that when they were young and tender, and could do nothing for themselves, they undertook and acted for them, but now that they are come to the years of Discretion, and understand their Obligations, they must undertake and act for themselves, and that hence forth, if they neglect their Dutys, the guilt must ly at their own door, they must be accountable for it to the Judge of Quick and Dead.</p>
                     <p>And here it will be proper for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to suggest two things unto their Children; 1. The Nature and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that Consent, which they must give to their <hi>Baptismal Covenant.</hi> 1. It must be free and ingenuous, not forced and constrained, but such as issues from the generous Principles of Love and Gratitude. 2. Resolute and Hardie, not Faint and Cowardly, such as will be dash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at every Turn by the least trifling
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104909:76"/> Inconvenience; But such as will couragiously run through the greatest, and most discouraging difficulties and dangers rather than fail in the discharge of their Obligations. 3. Entire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reserved; such as will not allow any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacie with sin, even the dearest and most fashionable, and most advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; nor decline any Duty, even the hardest, most uneasie, and unaccept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to corrupt nature; not partial and byassed, forsaking some sins only, but hugging others; performing some Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys, such as are chape and easie; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooking others, that will pinch and do violence to the Flesh, and Self-Love. 4.

Present and Peremptory, not lingring and full of Delays. <hi>To day while it is called to day. Now is the acccpted time.</hi> Off-puts great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gratifie the Devil, and is a certain Evidence of Hypocrisy; a present Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance is very acceptable unto GOD, who takes it well, that we enter into his Way, as soon as ever it is made known to us: For out speedy chusing of it, is an Indication that we believe it to be the best, most safe, and most pleasant; whereas our delaying to engage in it, plainly enough insinuats, that we are yet in doubt, whether the way of the Devil, the World, and the Flesh, be better and more pleasant than His; which is an horrible Reflection on His Wisdom and Goodness. 6. Constant and Persevering; such as will oblige to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104909:77"/> run out the Race, and to be faithful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Death, not for some little time, or by Fits and Starts, now breaking off, and again resuming our Resolutions, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards within a little letting them fall, sometimes joining issue with the Devil and Sin, and then taking some Turns in the Camp of the Holy JESUS, and yet basely retreating again: Alas! these Vicissitudes of seeming Piety, and real Wickedness, are shameful and inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and unbecoming the constancy of an ingenuous Disciple.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other thing they are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn their Children, is, That in giving their Consent, to adhere to their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal Covenant, and to discharge the Obligations of it, they do it not in their own strength, but in an humble depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Grace and Spirit of the Holy <hi>JESƲS;</hi> who assures them that <hi>Without him they can do nothing:</hi> When men engage in the Spiritual Warfare, confiding in their Abilities, it is no wonder, though their Hearts fail them, and their Courage fagg, when they rencounter, and feel these mighty and formidable Oppositions, which their many and potent, and cunning
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104909:78"/> enemies will unweariedly make unto them; Whereas, if they did, in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lists with their strong and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate corruptions, and the powers of darkness, that are confederate with them, <hi>seek the LORD and His Strength, His Grace would be sufficient for them,</hi> and make his Yoak easie, and his Burden light, and even the strait and narrow Way, Pleasant and Delightful unto them. He would inspire them with such noble Courage, and Divine Strength, as would soon foile their enemies, and put them to a shameful flight.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When Parents have seriously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoke, and happily gain'd the consent of their Children to the Baptismal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, their next Task is further to urge and encourage them, to discharge the duties of it with diligence, Fidelity and Constancie, and that by represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them on the one hand; the Vast and Endearing priviledges of such, as heartilie engage to be, and are invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciblie resolved to continue; the Disciples and Votaries of the Holy JESUS; and on the other, the inconceivable miseries of such as desert His Services and treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erously apostatize from the allegiance
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104909:78"/> which they swear to him, 1: Then they are to tell them that such as adhere to the Baptismal Covenant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously to discharge the duties of it, have GOD for their Father. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Father is sweet and obliging and very advantagious, especially, if the Father be not only affectionat, but Rich, and great, and powerful: and who not only dearly loves his Children but is also in a capacitie to give Good Things unto them, and to do great Things for them. To be sure then, the Endearings and Advantages of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation must infinitly increase, when the Blessed GOD owns it, Whose Love, and Fulness, and Power are equally In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. Now GOD expresly declares, that He stands thus related to all sincere Christians, and that not in a larger sense only, as they are his Creatures, but in a stricter and more comfortable sense, as they are born of Him, partake of his Nature, bear His Image, and represent Him in their Dispositions and Practices, and carrie towards Him as dutiful and Obedient Children. Hence Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in His discourses to His Disciples, so often recommends Him to them,

Where the latter is not admitted, the former must infallibly take place: And as the Souls of all True &amp; Faithful Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are the Temples of the Holy Ghost, so the souls of such treacherous Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tats, as practically renounce their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism and Christianity, are the residen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this accursed spirit, who inspires them with his own abominable lusts, teaches them the lessons of prophanitie and vice, acts them as his slaves, and leads them in the <hi>broad way.</hi> O how lamentable a state is it to be under the horrid and black impressions of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of darkness, and to have no other comforter no other guide, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer and murtherer of Souls.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have deduced some of the most important considerations; that Parents should make use of; In perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Children to fidelity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance, in performing the duties of their Baptismal Covenant; And these considerations, Parents should first ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der familiar to themselves, and then inculcate on their Children, with seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and frequency. But this leads me,</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:104909:86"/>2ly. To declare some things which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ought to do on their part, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to mannage aright, and carry on this very Momentous instance of duty. And here I shall recommend these things. 1. That when they put their Children in mind of their Baptismal Covenant, they fail not to remember and renew their own Vows, especially if they are sensible that they have been such as have made no Conscience of them. But lived in a practical opposition to them. I think Parents cannot be Serious enough in urging their Children to mind and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their Baptismal Covenant, as long as they neglect it themselves, Neither can they reasonably hope that GOD will prosper this work in their hands, while he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ees them play the hypocrite, which they in an eminent manner do, when they pretend to perswade their Children to do that which they have no mind to do themselves, in doing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to be sure they can never be Sincere and ingenuous, nor with any confidence look up to GOD for his Blessing. And here I may establish it as a general direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, worthy of the consideration of all Parents, namely, that <hi>whatever they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104909:87"/> to the practice of their Children, they take special care to practice it themselves.</hi> To see habitual drunkards recōmend tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance to their Children, or such as as are unclean and adulterous Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending chastity; or the prophane and irreligious perswading to Devotion and seriousness; or the wrathful &amp; passionate, pressing meekness, is very rediculous; and their Children will never think they are in Earnest, but will believe that they may take the same libertie that they see their Parents take. It is true indeed, such Parents as have been effectually reclaimed from the practice of the mentioned, or like vices, may on good grounds diswade from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of them, and their Counsel may be very effectual to that end: because they speak from doleful and sad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the folly and madness of such practices, which disposes them to a passionat Seriousness, in perswading o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, either to abandon, or not to engage in these hurtful and dangerous wayes: But the Exhortation of vicious men, are but vain and empty words, and such as have commonly no other effect, but to make Religion and Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104909:87"/> matter of sport and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>If it be said, that the exhortations of wicked persons may have influence to recommend Vertue, becaule though their Parents be contrary to it, Yet their commendations of it are the result of an inward conviction, which they have in their minds, of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it; and what greater engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the practice of vertue, then to hear its very enemies commend and perswade to it? It is answered, that if any shall be so wise, as to make such good Improvements of these Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I cannot but highly approve their so doing, though it is certain this is not their ordinary Consequence, but rather the contrary, even that which I have just now intimated. But further, The commendations that wicked Persons give to Religion and Virtue, are so far from doing them any honour, that they really disparage them, because they represent Virtue as a weak ineffica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Thing; for tho they are (as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) convinced of its Excellencie, yet the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> chuse rather to do the contrary, whereby they plainly insinuate, that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104909:88"/> what ever discoveries they have of the beauty of Virtue, yet there are other things, which they think have a greater and more overcoming beautie in them, namely, these things which they practically love and pursue, that is to say, in effect the filthiest vice; so that if there were no other beautie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable in Virtue, then what vitious persons see, its like very few would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come its Votaries. Besides, <hi>I</hi> cannot understand what other influence the Commendations, which vitious persons give to Virtue, can have on the hearers, but such as it hath on the Exhorters themselves, that is, to <hi>commend Virtue without practising it.</hi> If it be furder urged, that then wicked persons should not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort at all to the practice of Virtue? I answer, that it is indeed the Duty of wicked persons to exhort, but not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly; there are somethings they must carefully first set about the doing of, before they can be competently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for this Work, that is, they must abandon their vices, reform their Lives, and heartily engage in the practice of Virtue, and when they are experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly acquainted with its power, sweetness
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104909:88"/> and advantages, then it is that their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to the practiee of it, are likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to take effect. The summ of all is, that it is the living and vigorous sence of Religion, on the hearts of the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. That Parents, before they enter u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this great work of putting their children in mind of their Baptismal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and obliging them to give their consent to it; do set some time a part for humble and serious prayer, and recommend their purpose and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to GOD, earnestly intreating, that he would countenance and second their indeavours, with the influences of his Heavenly Grace. They must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that they are but instruments, and that GOD is the principle Agent in the Salvation of their Children; and though he requires that men cooperate with his Grace, yet he would not have

It is allowed of by the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, and constantly practised in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whose peculiar Character it is, that it payes a just vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to all Ancient &amp; good Customes, and loves to retain them, but retrenches the abuse of latter times.

But I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to impose on, or quarrel with any on this head; only I doubt not but it will be agreed on by all; that it is the indispensable duty of Parents to put their Children in mind of their <hi>Baptismal Covenant,</hi> and to ingage them to give their actual consent unto it: and when it is their lot to be in a Church, whose custom it is not, to do this more solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104909:90"/> and publickly, that they ought to do it in private, with as obliging cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances as can be; and the whole in my Judgement, may be very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably mannaged after this manner. 1st. That the Parents fix a day for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing this renewal, and ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Baptismal Covenant. 2. That the Child or Children be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the design, and that injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be given them conscienciously to prepare for it. 1st. By serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of their vow in its nature, obligations and vast moment, as hath been formerly represented. 2. By ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest prayers &amp; suplications to GOD, <hi>that he would by his powerful Grace incline their Hearts unto his testimonies,</hi> and enable them to <hi>

                           </gap>ield themselves to him absolutely, unreservedly, and for ever.</hi> 3. That some pious Relations, or Neighbours be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished to be present at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, particularly such, if they can be conveniently had, as were witnesses at the Baptizing of the Children, who should come with good wishes, and help with their Prayers, and be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses also to the ratification of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal Covenant: And specially, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104909:90"/> the presence of the Pastor be intreated, who if he be a serious and good man, will not refuse to assist at such Pious Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And indeed His Piety, Experience and Station, qualifies him to discharge the duties of this occasion, to better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose &amp; greater edification then any other. 4. When the fixed day hath approached, and the persons invited are met, the Children called, and the whole Family, for their common Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, assembled together in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place, which the Pastor being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, may be the Church, then it is fit that the Pastor, or, if he cannot be had, the Parent, begin with humble and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote Prayers, beseeching GOD, that He would vouchsafe to Countenance the Work they are about, with His Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and Gracious Presence, that He would turn the Hearts of the Young Ones to Himself, and strengthen them sincerely to renew their Baptismal Vows, and to make ingenuous Surrenders of themselves unto Him, and to engage in His Service, with firm and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Resolutions, never to swerve from it any more; And that, to this Effect, He would impart unto them liberal
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104909:91"/> measures of His good Spirit. 5. After these Devotions are ended (in which all are supposed to have heartily concurred) then in the next place, it is proper that the Child or Children be called up, and that the Pastor, if present, or otherwise the Parent, rehearse all the Dutys of the Baptismal Covenant in their Audience, and their consent be sought severally to each Article, by express and particular Interrogatories, according as it hath been recommended in the forgoing part of this Section. And this being done; Then 6l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. Let it be sensibly represented to Children, that now they have undertaken for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that by their own consent and express Promises, they have engaged to be the Disciples and Followers of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and that from henceforth the care of working out their Salvation, is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally devolved on themselves; And that therefore they must labour diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wrestle Couragiously, mortifie Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, Obey Universally, and Pray Fervently, <hi>and strive to enter in at the strait gate, and to make their Calling and Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sure.</hi> 7ly. After which it will be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, in order to perswade them to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104909:91"/> Fidelity and Constancy, in discharging the Dutys of their renewed Vows, to use some pertinent and affecting Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, taken from the Considerations above mentioned; and with all to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn them, not to be discouraged by any difficulties, and oppositions that may befal them, at their entrance into the Christian Warfare; For that these will soon over, and that GOD will Support and Strengthen, Guide and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence them by His good Spirit, and that in end, the hardest Duties, will become not only easie, but also Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and Dlightful, and even Natural unto them. 8ly, And in Fine, let the whole be shut up with Prayer, wherein the Supplicant is humbly to intreat, that GOD would graciously receive these Young Ones, who have now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated themselves to Him, into His Favour and peculiar Care; That He would perfect the good Work in them, which He hath enabled them to begin, that He would keep them from the evils of the World, and seal them by His Holy Spirit, unto the Day of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and increase His Divine Graces in them day by day, and teach them His

And last of all, it will not, I think, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to conclude with Praises: For which Purpose, let a selected Portion of the Psalms of <hi>David,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if I be allowed to prescribe, the two first Sections of the CXIX be sung with Devotion and Seriousness. And now upon the review of all, I assure my self that all pious Hearts will approve of the method I have laid down. Only let it be still remembred that I do not magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterially dictate, but lovingly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, what I conceive to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest Means to effectuate the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses now in hand.

                        <hi>Chearfully to submit unto, patiently to enduro, and even to desire, and to be content with all
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104909:99"/> these Wayes and Means, that may most effectually contribute to the Crucifixion, and Destruction of corrupt Nature, though never so uneasy, so contrary, and so disagreeable to it.</hi> For corrupt Nature is the great enemy of our Salvation; This is the adversary that doth most successfully hinder us in our marches Heaven-ward,<note place="margin">Reasons of and Inducements to the practice of this Duty.</note> and gives all our other enemies advantages over us, and opportunities to vanquish and enslave us. 'Tis by this, as being his own element, that the Devil hath easie access into our Hearts, to tempt and seduce us; this is the Engine that he dextrously manages to work out our ruin; by this it is that we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the Flatteries of a deceitful World and to be deluded by its guilded and guileful appearances. In fine it is this corrupt nature, especially when che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, countenanced and followed, that keeps the Holy Spirit, that Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed principle of Divine Life, from taking Possession of our Hearts, and working in us. And therefore the sooner that corrupt nature is mortified and overcome, the sooner is our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104909:100"/> secured. And consequently it cannot but appear very just and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, that all who are tender of their Eternal Happiness, should pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently &amp; chearfully submit unto, &amp; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace whatever may effectually tend ro the destruction &amp; rooting out of corrupt nature, though it be never so unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to it. Hence it is, that our Blessed Saviour, after having cxhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that would be His Disciples to deny themselves, enjoyns them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take up their Cross, as the great Mean of crucifying and exterminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old Man. For by the Cross we are to understand all these troubles and afflictions, whither inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that may befal us in this State of Tryal: And by <hi>taking it up,</hi> is meant a chearful and patient, an unrepining and contentful undergoing these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles as very useful, and even necessary for purifying us from our natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Now these troubles, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready intimated, are either inward or outward. The <hi>Outward,</hi> are either such as by a <hi>Providential Direction</hi> are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to fall on us, as poverty, sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, reproaches, persecutions, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104909:100"/> death, or voluntary and chosen, as Fasting, Watchings, taking for our selves the meanest things and lowest places, and the like Pious and Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Rigors The <hi>Inward</hi> are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, Godly Sorrows, Penitential Remorses, and in a word, all these painful Sensations within us, which result from the Operations of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit conflicting with, and rooting out our corruptions. Now all these troubles we must patiently endure, and chearfully embrace, not only as the just consequences and fruits of our sins, but as very proper Medicins to cure our diseased nature.</p>
                     <p>It is true, the <hi>Old Man</hi> will be ready to say with the <hi>Jews</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">John 6.60.</note>
                        <hi>These are hard sayings who can hear them?</hi> The flesh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure so rough and so severe a treatment, but will be apt to be angry, and to pick quarrels at the Doctrines that press and urge its ruin. Corrupt nature loves smooth and easie Schems of Divinity; It dearly values a Gospel, that assures it that all things are done for it, without putting it self to any trouble; It would have ease and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in both Worlds; And the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104909:101"/> that must flatter it, and secure its repose, and withall blow it up with hope of Eternal Life, do wonderfully please it. However it is certain that in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, nothing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for it but Crucifixion, Death, and utter extirpation. And of this great and most weighty Truth, Young Ones must with all possible care, be made very early sensible, and trained up, not only meekly and patiently to bear, but even to love whatever may effectually contribute to the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their corrupt natures. And to do this, they must be encouraged from two Considerations especially. 1st.

                        <hi>to have suffered these things, and then to enter into his Glory?</hi> Now since the innocent and harmless Lamb of GOD, having once assumed our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal humanity, could not escape Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, though he did no sin, <hi>Neither was guile</hi>

                        <hi>found in his mouth,</hi> how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable is it, that sinful and poluted worms should expect immunity from them? 2. That all the followers of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104909:101"/> JESUS must be conform unto him: such as were his circumstances in this World, such of necessity must theirs be. <hi>They</hi>
                        <note n="‡" place="margin">Phil. 2.10.</note>
                        <hi>must know the fellowship of his Sufferings, being made conformable unto his Death: And fill up that which is behind of</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Col: 1.24.</note>
                        <hi>the afflictions of CHRIST in their flesh.</hi> They must travel in that same way that the Blessed JESUS hath chalked out unto them, which is not a way of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ease and pleasure, but as himself as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us, a <hi>strait and narrow,</hi> that will pinch, and severely grate upon, and even quite distroy the flesh, and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nature, before it comes to the end of it.</p>
                     <p n="8">8ly. From this, lastly, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents are obliged with most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious endeavours to <hi>guard their young ones against the most notable eruptions,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>8ly.</hi> The most remarkable and pernicious instances of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, are with special care to be watched against and suppressed in young ones.</note>
                        <hi>or instances of corrupt nature, such as are self-love, self will, self-esteem, or Pride, self-Confidence, Sensuality, and Covetousness.</hi> It is true, these Vices are so twisted and interwoven together, that where one is, the others readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are; however they may admit of a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104909:102"/> distinct consideration, and must be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally cautioned against.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Self-Love,</hi> Corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is very fond and tender of it self:<note place="margin">Some of those instances enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, with an account of their hainous Nature, and the methods of their Cure.</note> It dearly loves its ease, and Pleasures and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; and cannot endure to think of forfeiting these on any terms; for it would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be flattered and gratified, and will not away with roughness and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities. It seeks and aims at <hi>Self</hi> in every thing: Whatever it designes or does, <hi>Self</hi> is the Principle, and <hi>Self</hi> is the end.<note place="margin">1. Self-love.</note> From this it is that it takes its measures of all Dispensations and Doctrines: For these things that please and favour <hi>Self</hi> most, are, in its esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; the best; and whatever doth cross and offend it is presently accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted evil. In a word, <hi>Self</hi> is the <hi>Deity</hi> that corrupt nature adores, to which it refers all things, and by which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Men are set at the greatest distance from, and most visible oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to God: For in effect men in this case do put themselves in the room of God, and fall down before and Worship themselves, and so become
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:104909:102"/> their own Idol, and give that love to themselves which is due to God only. For all which, it evidently appears how necessary it is, that young Ones be early instructed with <hi>Job</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Job. 42.6.</note>
                        <hi>to abhor Themselves,</hi> that is, absolutely to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim and renounce <hi>Self,</hi> together with all the dictates and inclinations of it, as infinitely worthy of hatred and dislike. And to do this, they must be urged from the consideration of that degeneracy and corruption, these wants and imperfections, these Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and Diseases that are visible in them, and whereof they cannot but be very sensible. And hence they are to be convinced that in themselves, who are but sinful, corrupted and miserable Creatures, there is nothing lovely, and consequently that <hi>Self hatred</hi> and not <hi>Self love</hi> is their Duty: But in the mean time, they are to be informed, that this self-hatr'd must only aim at, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the ruin and destruction of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature. It is their duty to preserve and support their mortal Life by all lawful Means, but then their design in so doing must be, that they may have the longer time, and greater conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104909:103"/> for crucifying the old man: And when they cannot any longer get it kept, either because nature hath come to its utmost period,<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 90.10.</note> or because a good conscience and the Love of GOD oblige them to sacrifice it, then they must chearfully and patiently submit to Death, as the Holy JESUS their Blessed Pattern did, rejoicing to be conform to him in all things. And when Parents have thus discovered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Children how unsuitable it is for poor, and emptie, and degenerat Worms to love themselves, in whom there is nothing, but what deserves hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and aversation; It will be a season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Juncture to address their Love to GOD, that Soveraign, and infinitly lovely Object, for whom this Noble Faculty was planted in the Soul, and Who, as He is in Himself the source of eternal Beauties, Perfections and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities, so in the Love of Him, (which when it is sincere, ardent and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is inseparable from the Fruition of Him,) consists the Beauty, Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Blessedness of our Souls.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Self-Will,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Self-will.</note> This is another very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent branch of corrupted nature,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104909:103"/> and immediatly issues from self Love; for when men becomes lovers of their own selves, there is nothing in Self that is dearer to them than their own wills, these they would have set up as absolute Dictators, and are impatient that they should be contradicted: And therefore one of the most considerable duties which Parents owe their Young Ones, and one of the greatest kindnesses they can do them, is to habituate them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to deny their own wills; For the will of man, since the entrance of sin is corrupted and disunited from the Will of GOD, and consequently is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very dangerous Guide; and yet this is the guide, I mean, our will as separated from the Divine will, that we are all inclined to follow. This is that which we would set up as the measure and rule, not only of our own actions, but of the actions of others also, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of these of GOD Himself, at whose providential Dispensations we repine and murmure, when they seem not to suite, or agree with our capricious and corrupted wills. Now this carnal <hi>self-will</hi> begins very early to discover it self in Young Ones, and therefore Parents
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104909:104"/> must very seriously endeavour to inure them to the denyal of it, and in order thereto, take all occasions lovingly to break and crush it: I say <hi>lovingly</hi> to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that a great deal of prudence, and discretion is necessary, for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging this part of their duty; for it ought to be so managed, as that the Children may be sensible, that it is their good and advantage that is ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at, in this crossing, and not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying their wills; they should so deal with them as to let them see, that all the severities used towards them, are the result of love to them, and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for their wellfare. As little humor, and passion as possible, should appear in their way of treating them for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, instead of teaching them, to deny their wills, they will teach them, to be humourous and self willed; for an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous and unaccountable conduct in the Parents, will naturally instill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and wilfulness in the Children: 'Tis true Parents are not obliged, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought they, to give reasons of all the particular instances of their conduct towards their Children; it ought to satisfie them in the general, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104909:104"/> thcir Parents do to them, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise them, is for their good, and so they are obliged to obey implicitly, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when they cannot understand the reasons of every particular Duty. But still the Parent should deal with them, as much as possible they can in lovc and meekness. And by this means they will become tractable, docile and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and more ready to notice, and follow the Wills and Commands of their Parents, than their own. It is the commō course of Parents to please their Children so long, by letting them have what they crave, and what they will, till their Wills are so used to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, that they cannot endure to be denyed, and so can endure no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because they can endure no cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of their Wills. To be obedient, is to renounce their own wills, and to be ruled by their Parents, or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours Wills: To use them therefore to have their own Wills, is to teach them Disobedience, and harden them to a kind of impossibility of obeying: They must be told often with Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liartiy and Love, of the Excellency of Obedience, and how it pleaseth
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104909:105"/> God, and what need they have of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and how unfit they are to govern themselves, and how dangerous it is to have their own Wills. But the great Design that Parents should aim at, in breaking the Wills of their young Ones, must not be, meerly to train them up in a Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to themselves, but to dispose them for, and to direct them to an absolute acquiescence in, and obedience to the Divine Will; and therefore they are to be informed, that the Wise and Holy, the just and good will of God, must be the Rule and Measure of their Wills: That is, that they must Will only in conformity to his blessed Will, and that whatever it injoynes, is to be obeyed without reserve, and without dispute, and all its Dispensations chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acquiesced in, even when the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of its injunctions, and disposals are not understood; being well assured, that whatever it commands or dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, even though cross to, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing with their corrupted Wills, is really for their good. And to this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute submission to the Divine Will,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104909:105"/> they are to be encouraged 1. From the example of Christ, who<note n="*" place="margin">Joh: 5.30.</note>

                        <note place="margin">3. Self-esteem</note> As corrupt nature dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loves it self, so it highly values it self; for being wholly averted from GOD, and from the view of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Beauties and Perfections, its Eyes are turned towards it self, and views and considers only its own fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perfections, and swells with big ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of it self Hence it is that corrupt nature greatly desires applause,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104909:106"/> and Praise, and Commendation; it would have it self Honoured and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, yea even in a manner Deified and Adored; and in whatsoever it does, especially in Religious things, it aims at its own esteem; and if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to fail in any thing, it regrets, not that GOD is dishonoured, or his own Soul, or the Souls of others prejudged, but, that dear self is reflected on, and dishonoured; for it cannot endure to meet with disgrace, or contempt, it scornes to obey and to suffer, it Loves, and would have the finest things, and the highest places, would be Superiour to all, and looks on others with slight and disdain: It sees not its own Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Deformities, or if it doth, it sees them under quite another Aspect, that is, as pleasant, as agreeable and decent; for it will defend its own Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and vizard them over with the masques of Vertues, and recommends its own practices as the only imitable patterns; so that <hi>Pride</hi> is one of the most accursed Weeds that is in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruped Nature; 'tis deeply rooted in it, and very early and insensibly Springs up and manifests it self, and is

                        <hi>it self above all that is called GOD.</hi> Whence it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that it is the indispensible duty of Parents, to check this hatefull vice in the first appearances of it, and to use all possible care to root it out, which otherwise will infallibly prove ruinous and destructive to their Souls. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! Parents generally are so far from endeavouring to discover this abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable weed of pride in their Children, with design to suppress and extirpat it, that they cherish, and foment it, by flattering, praising, and commending them, and arraying them in fine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and by such other practices, as naturally tend to beget in them Self-conceit, and big opinions of their own worth: But such as incline to be tender of the eternal welfare of their Young Ones, must steer by another compass, and therefore to these, I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. 1. That they endeavour to make their Children know themselves well, for (as a very excellent and most divine Soul observes) <q>True Humility consists in a perfect Knowledge of Ones self. For he that knows himself
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104909:107"/> well can never be proud, nor have any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of himself, he will not glory in the praises and honours of men; he will not desire Riches to be adored or served, for an humble heart believes that it deserves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and the least things content and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie it; an humble heart is not in wrath for being abased or despised, because he seeth, in knowing himself, that he deserves nothing, but is worthy of all contempt. And whereas that is not practised among men, it is because they know not themselves, and so judge themselves worthy of esteem and honour, riches and service, and that makes them proud: For if they observ'd well whence they are, what they are, and what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them, it were impossible that they should in the least esteem themselves; on the contrary, they would see that they deserve all sort of contempt, because they are as to the soul, frail, ignorant and unconstant, and as to the body full of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, infirmities, and diseases, lyable to death and corruption:</q>

But to return to our design, Parents cannot choose but discern from this, that it is their duty, in order to prevent the growth of Pride in their Children, to begin very early to make them sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that they are fallen and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated creatures, and that they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they can call their own but their sins and corruptions, their wants and Imperfections, and that therefore they ought to have mean thoughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to believe that they deserve nothing, but the worst of things: And that when they are praised they ought to disclaim it, as not being their due, and when they are ill treated, meekly and calmly to submit to it, as being that which justly belongs to them.

Hence it appears, that Parents are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned to endeavour, as soon as possible, to beget in their Children a deep sense of their emptiness and insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, their darkness and ignorance, their weakness and folly, their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and corruption, and solidly to convince them that there is nothing in themselves that can relieve them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these Miseries, but that it is God only that by his Light and Grace can restore, heal and purify their Souls, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten their Understandings, calm and satisfy their Desires, acquaint them with the Secrets, and open their Eyes to see the wonders of his Law. And that consequently it is their Duty wholly to distrust themselves, not to lean to their own Understandings and natural Activity, but intirely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves to the Operations and Conduct of the Holy Spirit, who not only assists and operats in all, who sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely desire and admit of him, but even prevents their Desires, by his gracious Motions and Solicitations, whereby he awakens them to desire, But something to this purpose hath
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104909:109"/> formerly been insisted on, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
                     <p n="5">5ly. Sensuality,<note place="margin">Sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> As Corrupt nature hath a great aversion for what is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and uneasie to it, so it hath a wonderful liking to what ever flatters, pleases, and agreeably affects it. It would willingly Swime in pleasures, and not feel any thing but what is smooth, delicious, and Relishing: And indeed there is no doubt, but these inclinations, and desires which we have after joyes and satisfaction, are deeply rooted in Humane Nature, but they are such as were designed for quite other joyes than these, to the research whereof corrupt nature applyes them: for it seeks no other pleasures than such as immediatly issue from the Creatures, and if it have aboundance of these, it concludes it self happy enough, although it never feel any of these higher, truely Satisfying and only permanent Joyes, which flow from the Presence and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of God in the Soul, and hence it is, that corrupt Nature is so excessively addicted to these pleasures, which come to it by the natural Senses. It is certain, that as the essential happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104909:110"/> of Man consists in the perception, and fruition of the Light and Joyes of GOD, or in these Felicities which GOD doth immediatly, and by Himself communicate unto the Soul; So doubtless, GOD designed a kind of Accessary Happiness to Man, by means of the senses, for in the state of Innocence, the Senses were as so many Windows, at which the Works of GOD, these beautiful Representations of His perfections, did enter, and were presented into the Soul of Man, and by which he did agreeably feel their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall impressions, which were to him, both as so many memorials of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine excellencies, &amp; as incentives to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to ascend in gratefull, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming acknowledgements, to that most generous and most powerfull Goodness, which not only gave Being to such vast Numbers of Amiable and Glorious Creatures, but also gave him capacities, and powers to feel their delightfull Qualities, so that man in this state, did not rest in these pleasures, which were afforded him by means of his Senses, nor view them without respect to any other thing but his own satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104909:110"/> but by them, his mind was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up to the Contemplation, Love, and praise of their glorious Original; and so he did feel, and see, and taste GOD in every Thing, and referred all things to Him: But now in this state of degeneracy and corruption, how lamentably is the Scene altered? for instead of taking occasion from the pleasures which our Senses afford us, by their converses with the Creatures, of devoutly mounting up to the Blessed Source of the sweetnesses and perfections that are in them, we use them only as means of our own satisfaction: Corrupt nature doth not any more either seek or feel GOD in the Creatures; and that which it aims at, in the use of its Senses with respect to them, is its own ease and pleasures; <hi>For (as the exellent Person lately mentioned hath it)</hi>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104909:111"/> in embracing the chastisements of GOD be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of sin: And if he will satisfie his smell by good odours, it is to repell the putridity which sin hath brought upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And if he will satisfie his Feeling, it is but to defile his Soul by these unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pleasures which he takes in Feeling.</q> And so we may add with respect unto the Taste, that the design which we propose to our selves in Eating and Drinking, is not meerly to relieve the necessities of Nature, which doubtless is allowed us, but to gratifie self, and hence it is, that we are not pleased, with the courser Entertainments, but we desire and search after the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and pleasing Meats and Drinks, which do the more agreeably touch our Pallats, and consequently affords cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature the greater pleasure. And therefore it is certain, that Parents should take great care to speak to their Children, dishonourably, and with disparagements of sensual pleasures, and seriously to tell them, that these are infinitly unworthy of Creatures that were designed for the Joyes and Felicities of GOD. And that they may discharge aright this part of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:104909:111"/> I shall recommend five things unto them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That they inform their Children, That their inordinate addicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to sensual pleasures, will insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, and yet most effectually extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the Love of GOD in them, and draw away their hearts from Him: <q>

And if we yeeld to the sense of Hearing, the heart delights in it, and the affection is drawn to it. It is even so with smelling, where the sensitive part takes pleasure. And if we please our selves in Taste, all our care and study are imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to search means to satisfie it, and that sense is more unsatiable than any other, and precipitats unto all sorts of sins. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it excites the sense of Feeling; for he that pleases his taste, seeks also to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his feeling with pleasure and satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Even all the five Senses are moved
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104909:112"/> only by the love we carry to our selves, and desire of affording our selves pleasure. Now assuredly all these things withdraw us from GOD, and from Dependence on Him, For He hath commanded us to <hi>love Him with all our heart,</hi> and so wills not that we fix our hearts on things so frail and vile, as are the Sight, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Smelling, Taste, and Feeling; for it is unworthy of the Divine Soul that GOD hath given us, and which is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Loving an Eternal GOD, Who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and commands that we love Him with all our hearts, to give its Love to such poor and mean satisfactions, as are the pleasures of sense. So that the Man that hath effection for his senses, voluntarly quits the Dependence of GOD, seing he doth not submit himself to his will, who requires that we should love him with all our heart.</q> Men commonly think that they may gratifie their Senses, and love the pleasures they afford, very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently, and without any incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the great Command of Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD with all our heart; but were we sensible how deeply our Senses are corrupted, how prone we are to love our selves and our satisfactions, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104909:112"/> how easily the pleasures of sense imposes on us, and quickly gain such interest in our affections as will justly denominate us to be <hi>Lovers of pleasures more then Lovers</hi>

The devil no sooner perceived that, but he enticed him by the five natural Senses, (which are as the five windows of our heart,) that he might withdraw his heart and affections from GOD, and place them on visible and sensible things, the devil then first moved <hi>Adams</hi> heart to regard the beautifull creatures, which GOD had created for him; he moved also his sense of hearing, to give attention to the false perswasions of that old serpent, who made him believe that he should know good and evil, if he did eat the fruit of the Tree, which GOD had forbid him to eat of, he moved him to put his band to touch the Apple, his smelling to smell it, and his taste to eat it, and by that means the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil carried <hi>Adams</hi> heart and affections to the Creatures, and turned him away from the Love he owed to GOD:</q> This was the first Temptation by which the devil assaulted man, and finding it so

Since it is certain that some use of our sense is allowed us: Yea, even is necessary for us, for if we did not use them, it were not possible for us to live; And therefore, that there may be no miscarriage committed in the Lawful and allowed use of them, Three things are to be earnestly recommended, and prest upon Children, 1. That they take special care, never to gratifie their sense in any excessive and extravagant manner, but that they strenuously la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to confine them to what is simply necessary. And to know what that is which is simply necessary, we need not but seriously consult experience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and the love of GOD, which, if we are willing to be resolved, will soon determine us: For there cannot

They are to be taught, when they feel the pleasure of their senses, and perceive the creatures that cause these pleasures, not to stop in the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of them, or in the consideration of the objects that ocasion them: But by means of them, with love, praise and admiration, to lift up their Hearts constantly unto, and devoutly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template, that adoreable, most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and most Communicative cause that gave b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104909:115"/> stay in themselves, without any high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er prospect; but that by them we should sally up towards their bountiful Auth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and so return and offer up his own creatures to him, as whole burnt-offerings from the Altar of inflamed and ravished hearts. And therefore, when we see beautyful objects, hear har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Sounds, or smell fragrant od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, taste delicious meats, &amp; Liquors, or touch agreeable things; We should improve these pleasures into opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Devotion, and look upon them as our remembrancers of the rich and munificent Bounty of GOD.</p>
                     <p n="4">4ly. It is further to be recommended to the Consideration of Young Ones, that by excessive indulging themselves the use of sensuall pleasures, or even by using of them at all without the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned References, their Souls will be <hi>sadly dishonoured, will become brutal, dark, and poluted, void of GOD,</hi> and <hi>unsuitable</hi> to him, and <hi>uncapable of his Heavenly Delights:</hi> These excellent Spirits of ours, that were made for lodging the Deity, and for feeling these unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Joyes that are unseparable from the presence of GOD in a purified
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104909:115"/> Soul, are horridly prostituted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused, when only imployed in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and conversing with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in feeling these poor and mean satisfactions they can afford. How unbecoming is it that a Chamber of Presence, where the King with his Noble Attendants, and spendid Retinue ought to be only entertained, should be filled with Frogs Toads and Serpents, with poison, vermine, and excrement; just so it is that we treat our Souls which were designed to be filled with GOD, and His Joyes, where we admit nothing to enter unto them, but Creatures, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and sin.</p>
                     <p n="5">5ly. They are in the last place to be admonished, that, when any Objects noisome and offensive to their senses come in their way, they remember that this is the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Consequence</hi> of sin, which hath lamentably <hi>polluted</hi> and <hi>putrified</hi> and put an horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and disorder in every thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them and within them; for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less there was nothing but Purity and Agreeableness, beauty and good order, delightfull Harmonies, and delicious Fragrancies in the Creatures when they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104909:116"/> came out of the hands of GOD, from whom nothing could issue but what was exactly representative of his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, most agreeable, and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Nature.</p>
                     <p>And therefore when any thing of a contrary Nature and Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In it self it meets with nothing but emptiness, and it is unae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, and disaffected to the living source of true and solid satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; And therefore it carries it's crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hungrie desires <hi>to the World, and the things of the World.</hi> Hoping to find a full Satisfaction in <hi>drawing out of these broken Sisterns:</hi> But alace!

These are certainly the first appearances, and the early buddings, of the sin of Coveteousness which if not seasonably checked and controlled, will gather strength as they grow in years. And therefore a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable instance of the care of Parents must be, that they diligently guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Springing up of this pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Root. And that they may manage this part of their duty as they ought, I recommend the following particulars, 1. That assoon as their Young Ones are capable of it, they acquaint them with the true object of their desires, that is with GOD, that they display as they best can, his Divine Beauties and Perfections before them;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:104909:117"/> that they tell them, that the reason, as hath been alreadie intimated, why they were doted with the noble faculty of <hi>desiring infinitly,</hi> was, that they might vigorously pursue after, resolutely fix on, and eternally possess an <hi>Infinit Good.</hi> That this is the only object that can fill and satisfie the cravings, compose and calm the restlesness, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully quench the ardours of their migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty desires. And in fine, that they let them understand, that it was towards this all satisfieing and Blessed Object, all Good Souls have addressed this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faculty. So these Devotionists in <hi>Isaiah</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa: 26.8.9.</note>

Let them set before their eyes the example of the Blessed JESUS, who was so far from desiring, that he constantly, generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and universally, contemned the riches, and grandours, the State, and magnificence, the pomp, and glories of this vain World; and choos'd a poor mean, and despised Life: And this he did that he might let us see, what cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances are properest for this state of Trial, namely, not fulness, Ease and Plenty, honours, state, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, but rather the contrary, pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, meanness &amp; disgrace, as being most

                        </gap>esent to direct Parents how to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and mortifie in their Children. These are the black and violent Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that offer the greatest Indignities to Reason, that reject and scorn all it's sober dictats, that precipitate and hurry Men e're they are aware unto a thousand wild extravagancies, Yea, and that fear and Torment, disquiet and Crucifie, even these very Souls that harbour and entertain them. These passions are visibly the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the entrance of sin into the World; for I cannot understand what room or use they could have in pure and incorrupted nature, that is, if neither Angels nor Men had sinned, but all things had continued in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, rectitude, and glory, in which they were at first created. It is by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting these fierce &amp; untowardly passions have an uncontrolled swing and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, that the interests of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture get a full establishment in the Soul, and that Men are transformed into Devils: And therefore it cannot be but the Advantage as well as the duty
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104909:121"/> of all, vigorously to endeavour the suppression and even extirpation of them, both in themselves and in all that they have interest in. I shall not need to advertise Parents that these passions are deeply rooted in their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; For they naturally issue from corrupted Natures, such as theirs are; And accordingly they bewray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, not only in the more advanced years, but even in the very Infancy of Little Ones, which the Parents are made sensible of by a frequent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie experience. What Parents are to do during the Infancy of their Children with respect to the effects of corrupted Nature that then begin to appear in them, <hi>I</hi> hope I have alreadie<note n="*" place="margin">§. 13</note> suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared: But it is in their riper years, as their capacities, and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion advance, that the mortification and cure of these passions are to be most effectually attempted. And in order to the doing this to the best Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, I shall acquaint Parents with some things that they are to do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and some things that they are to recommend to their Children.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The particulars I would injoyn
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104909:121"/> Parents on this head, are these. 1. That they do not themselves, nor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer others needlesly and too often to rankle and exasperat their Children, and so awaken their passions; But that they labour as much as possibly they can, to preserve them in a smooth, and gentle, easie, and agreeable Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: For it is certain, that by their being alwayes kept fretting, wheening, and crying they become habitually froward stormie and passionat. To this purpose I may alledge, or at least accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat that of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph: 6.4.</note>
                        <hi>Fathers provoke not your Children to wrath.</hi> The reason of which injunction, besides that menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the Apostle elsewhere<note place="margin">Col: 3</note> taken from the fear of being discouraged, we may conceive to be this, namely, lest by the rigid and sever Treatment of the Parents, the Children be rendered froward, peevish, and passionat: For it is certain that when Parental Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, degenerats unto tyranny, humor or arbitrariness, it will be so far from pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>venting or reforming miscariages, that it will dispose for disobedience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and beget and cherrish per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness and ill nature. 2ly, That they
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104909:122"/> do in their own conversations, set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Children the example of Meekness and Gentleness, Patience and Contentedness, Charity and Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and such other Graces as are most opposite to the irascible Passions. I assure my self, that if Children did see Sweetness and Benignity daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified by the Parents, if they found them never in anger, but upon grave and important Occasions; this would be a very powerful Mean to derive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeableness and good Nature into the Children, who are naturally prone to imitate what they see the Parents prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise. Whereas if they shall alwayes see their Parents Stormy, and out of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and discontented, apt to quarrel, to resent, and to take vengeance, this will insensibly convey ill Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ure into them; for we soon learn the Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the manners of those we day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converse with. But this of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Parents, is of universal Influence in the Education of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and therefore must be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly treated of under another head. 3ly, They are not by any means, to be allowed to do any thing, that may
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104909:122"/> Excite, gratifie or cheerish ill nature, hatred or revenge. And here it will not be unseasonable to communicat the Advice of a late Celebrated Writer<note n="*" place="margin">Look in his thoughts concern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. § 110. p. 130.</note> One thing (sayeth he) I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently observed in Children <q>That when they have got possession of any poor Creature, they are apt to use it ill: They often torment and treat very roughly young Birds, Butter-flies, and such other poor Animals which fall into thier hands, and that with a seeming kind of pleasure. This I think should be watched in them, and if they incline to any such <hi>Cruelty,</hi> they should be taught the contrary usage; For the custom of tormenting and killing of beasts, will by degrees harden their minds, even towards Men: And they who delight in the suffering and destruction of inferiour Creatures, will not be apt to be very Compassionat or Benign to those of their own kind. Our practice takes notice of this in the exclusion of Butchers from Juries of Life. and Death Children should from the beginning be bred up in an abhorrence of killing and tormenting any living Creature, and be taught not to kill or destroy any thing, unless it be for the Preservation or Advantage of some other
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104909:123"/> that is Nobler.</q> Our Author cannot be perswaded, but this barbarous and inhumane disposition, which Young Ones bewray, is forreign and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: And certainly though the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of this, and all other perverse dispositions, be unquestionably rooted in degenerate nature, yet if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as an habit, we may justly say, that it is excited and begotten by Custom and Conversation. For as he adds; <q>People may teach Children to strike, and laugh when they hurt or see harm come to others: And they have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of most about them to confirm them in it. All the entertainments and talk of history, is of nothing almost but fighting and killing: And the honour and renown that is bestowed on Conquerours, who for the most part are but the great But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Mankind, farther mislead growing Youth, who by this means come to think slaughter the laudable bussiness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the most heroick Virtue. Thus custom plants unnatural appetits, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles us to that which it has laid in the way to honour: Thus by fashion and opinion, that comes to be a pleasure which in it self neither is nor can be any. This
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104909:123"/> ought carefully to be watched, and early remedied, so as to settle and eherish, the contrary and more naturall temper of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity and compassion in the room of it:</q> Thus doubtless nothing that savours of Cruelty, nothing that is inhumane, nothing that satisfies the black passions of envy, malice, and revenge ought to be countenanced in Children: On the contrary if the Parents shall observe that the inclinations of their Children, haue a special Tendeney to gratifie these affections, they are to suppress them with all caution and care; which leads me,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To tell Parents. What they are to recommend to their Children, in order to the suppressing and mortifie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these passions: And here, some things they are to recommend to their consideration, and some things to their practice.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They are to recommend to their Consideration, these particulars, name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly. 1. That if they follow the swing of their wrath and anger, and malice, envy and revenge, they will infallibly forfeit <hi>the repose and quiet of their minds;</hi> And consequently be certainly mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104909:124"/> in this world: For when these passions are allowed to rage and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer without control or restraint, they necessarily creat storms in the mind, and make it like the Troubled Sea, that cannot rest. Now if one be rob'd of the peace and serenity of his mind he cannot choose but be miserable; for let a man's other comforts be never so many and so great, yet he cannot relish them, as long as his inward man is out of tune and disjointed: And yet to this disadvantage they pepetually expose themselves, who take no care to check and crucifie their passions. <hi>For as an Excellent Author hath it</hi>

                        <hi>Whilst we are in this World, we must expect to be encompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with continual crowds of evil accidents, some or other of which will be alwayes press<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon or justling against us; so that if our minds are sore and uneasie, and over apt to be affected with evil, we shall be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie pained and disquieted. For whereas were our minds calm and easie, all the evil accidents that befall us would be but like a shower of hail upon the tylls of a musick house which with all its clatter and noise disturbs not all the harmonie that is within: Our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104909:124"/> too apt to be moved unto passion by them, uncovers our mind to them, and lays it open to the tempest!</hi> And though Men ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that by giving Vent to their passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they ease and allay the evils that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them, yet in effect they do but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and aggravat them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by so doing, they do, for instancc, add the torment of an outragious anger to the indignities that are offered them, and the smart of a peevish impatience to the sufferings that happen them, and make their want more uneasy, through an invidious pineing at anothers fulness, and sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the injuries they meet with, by a mallicious and revengeful Resentment of them. 2. Let it be gravely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to them, that these Passions, if they are indulged and continued in, until they Convert into inveterate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, do necessarly sink the Soul into the miseries of Eternity: For when a man goes unto the other World with these black and ill natured Passions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, in their full vigor, and without ever having used any effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al endeavours to suppress and mortifie them, to be sure, he carries his Hell and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104909:125"/> his Devils in his very Bosom: For, (that I may deliver my self in the emphatical and sinewy words of the Eloquent Author<note n="*" place="margin">Chr: life part 1. P. 64.</note> last mentioned) <q>All the irascible affections are in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses naturally vexations to the mlnd, and do alwayes disturb and raise tumults in it: For so <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>impatience</hi> distracts and alienates it from it self, and confounds it's thoughts and shuffles them together, unto a heap of wild and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly fancies. So <hi>malice, envy,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> do fill it with anxious biting thoughts, that like young Vipers, gnaw the womb that bears them, &amp; fret &amp; gall the wretched mind that forms and gives them Entertainment. And though in this World we are not so sensible of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, which these black and rankorous Passions do us, partly because our sense of them is abated with the intermixture of our bodily pleasures; and partly, because while we operate as we do by these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weildy Organs of Flesh; our reflections can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be comparably so <hi>quick,</hi> nor our Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons so <hi>violent,</hi> nor our perceptions so brisk and <hi>exquisit,</hi> as they will doubtless be when we are stript into naked Spirits: Yet, if we go away into the other World
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104909:125"/> with these affections unmortified in us, they will not only be far more violent and outragious than now; And we shall not only have a far <hi>quicker</hi> sense of them than now, But this our sharp sense of them shall be <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>simple,</hi> without any intermixture of pleasure to soften and allay it. And if so, Good LORD! What ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Tormenters</hi> will they prove, when an extream <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>hate, Envy</hi> and <hi>revenge</hi> shall be altogether like so many hungrie Vultures preying on our Hearts, and our minds shall be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie <hi>bated</hi> aend <hi>worried</hi> with all the furious thoughts which these outragious Passions can suggest unto us! When with the meagre eyes of Envy; we shall look up towards the Regions of happiness, and incessantly <hi>pyne</hi> and <hi>grieve</hi> at the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of these that inhabit them; when through a sense of our own folies, and of the miserable effects of them, Our <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>impatience</hi> shall be hightned and boyled up unto a <hi>diabollical fury:</hi> and when at the same time, an inveterate malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all we converse with, and a fierce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of revenging of our selves upon those who have contributed to our ruine, shall like a Wolf in our Breasts, be continually
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:104909:126"/> gnawing and feeding upon our Souls, what an unsupportable hell will we be to our selves! Doubtless that outward hell to which bad spirits are condemned is very terrible; But I cannot imagine, but that the worst of their hell is within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and that their own Devilish passions are severer furies to them, then all those Devils that are without them: For Wrath, and Envy, Malice, and Revenge, are both the Nature and the plague of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; And though as Angels they are the creatures of GOD, yet as Devils they are the Creatures of these their Devilish Affections; They were these that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them from Blessed Angels unto cursed fiends: And could they but once cease to be Envious; and Malicious, they would cease to be Devils, and turn Blessed Angels again. If then these ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous affections have such a Malignant Influence, as to <hi>blacken</hi> Angels unto Devils, and make them the most miserable, <hi>who were once the most Happy Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures; How can we</hi> ever expect to be Happy, so long as we indulge and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour them.</q> 3ly. Let them be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged often to think on these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that dehort from these Passions,

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. When Chlidren complain of the litle injuries and affronts that are done to them by their Camerads, and playfellows, Their Parents must effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:104909:128"/> engage them to bear these treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with Meekness and patience. They should tell them that they must suffer greater things than these, for the love of JESUS, that their Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was himself ill treated in this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World, and that they should be content to be dealt with in it, as he was, <hi>since the servant is not above his Lord;</hi> That they must suffer with him if they would Reign with Him. Thus ought the Parents to mitigate, and divert the Resentments of their Children, and not give Countenance to any thing that may highten or exasperate them; And therefore, it is that the Parents must not themselves, nor suffer their Children spitefully to threaten, to give reviling language unto, or take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance on the offenders, (For this were to inspire them with, and to root in them these execrable affections that we are cautioning against) but rather they should oblige them readily to forgive those that have injured them, and to do them some little Civilities or Courtisie, such as they are capable of and <hi>thereby teach them to overcome evil with Good,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Rom: 12.21.</note> It is true, when Children de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104909:128"/> and willfully, or out of ill nature, do some considerable hurt or prejudice to their Play-fellows, then their Parents or Governours must not fail to chastise them; But in the mean time, the injured must be taught not to rejoyce, or take pleasure in the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of him that hath done the wrong, but rather be grieved that his wicked nature prompted him to do such things as exposed him to punishment, and heartily to wish that his chastisements may reform and amend him. Thus Parents are very early to acquaint their Children with the maxims of the Cross of Jesus Christ, and to oblige them to practise accordingly. I know such Parents as <hi>conform unto the World,</hi> and follow its dictats in educating their Young Ones, will not readily down with this Injunction: They will be apt to say, that to traine them up at this rate would be to render them coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pusillanimous, to inspire them with snaking and sheepish dispositions; That they for their own parts are far better pleased to see their Children bold and couragious, apt to contend with, and domineer over their play-fellows,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:104909:129"/> to do mischief unto and take vengeance on those that offend them; That such things as these, are indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that they have Mettle and Spirit; Thus the world and corrupt nature do dictat. But alas! they are quite out in their Measures: For true Courage and Bravery do not consist in a heat &amp; ferment of the Blood and Spirit, since at this rate Mastives and Game-Cocks might commence Hero's; but in being so fenced and guarded with Divine Reasons and Considerations (such as these just now insisted on) as that no dolorous accident from without is able to invade our minds, or raise any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent commotions within us. He is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the bravest Hero that enters into the fields against himself, and combats his unreasonable and stormie affections, and continues fighting until he quell these monsters, and get such mastery over them, as that no temptations will prevail with him to be either envious in want, or impatient in suffering, or angry at contempt, or malicious and revengeful under injuries and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 3ly. It will be fit to enjoyn them, that they take care to check
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:104909:129"/> and controll their passions in their first risings; That as soon as they observe them begin to appear, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour vigorously to divert them, by some one or other of the Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons above mentioned, or if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get them at first wholly kept from making a stirr within, that at least they hinder them from breaking out at the mouth in exasperating and oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious Language; Since if once we give them vent this way, they can hardly afterwards be managed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained; For our words will add heat and fire to our Passions, and our Passions will edge our words with bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness, and so they will swell up to greater and greater hights, till in end Religion and Reason be dethron'd, and all their sober dictats disregarded; And then we act the parads of mad men: For there are no Scenes so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and so ridiculous, but we may while driven before the Torrent of our inraged passions be precipitated unto. Whence it is evident that it is our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trest to crush these cockatrices in the egg, and quench our passions while they are yet but a spark. 4ly. Let it
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:104909:130"/> be recommended to them, that they earnestly pray that the good Spirit of God, the Spirit of Peace and Love would come and inhabite their Souls, and by His gracious presence and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, sweeten, smooth, and calm their fierce and stormy &amp; rugged Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and fill their hearts with his peaceful and quieting fruits. In order to the casting out these devilish passions it is necessary that we use humble fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and fervent Prayers, and invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat a Power greater than our own to our assistance, in order to crush and dislodge these furies that our corrupted natures have hatched.</p>

                     <p>But afterwards when their cappaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104909:131"/> have advanced, it will not, I humbly think, be improper to guard &amp; fortifie them against the infectious influence of that <hi>wretched Atheism,</hi> which so desperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spreads &amp; prevails in this degenerat age: And that by furnishing their minds with such proofs of the existence of a Deity as, if well mannaged, will be sufficient to baffle and silence the Cavils and specious pretences of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical Witts. And to this purpose it will be very useful to acquaint them with these arguments that are insisted on by the Famous <hi>Descartes</hi> in the third and fifth of his Meditations, which though slighted by less penetrating minds, yet if well understood and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered will be found to amount to solid demonstrations, and very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in their kind. However I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge that I am of opinion, that these proofs that a late singularly, Pious, and eminently Learned Author<note n="*" place="margin">L'Oeconom: Divine Tome. <hi>1.</hi> C. <hi>1.</hi> Verameth: Pars <hi>3.</hi> Pag: <hi>137, &amp;c.</hi> By Monsieur Poiret.</note> offers unto us, ought to have the preferance of all others I have yet met with.

It is true, this Author supposes that the persons whom he would convince, are ingenuous, Candid, and impartial, and such as are very desirous to have their scruples so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly removed, and willing to receive satisfaction when ever it is offered to them: But as for such as are in a contrary disposition, he pretends to have nothing to do with them: And the truth is, it is but lost labour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to give satisfaction to those that are neither desirous nor willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. And further one of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or methods, that he makes use of, to perswad that there is a GOD, is of such a nature that in order to feel the force of it, one will be obliged to do that which the <hi>Atheists</hi> hath no great mind to, that is, <hi>To purifie the heart by emptying it of corrupt lusts and passions, of creatures and vanities,</hi> which when one
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104909:132"/> does, and then offers up his Soul unto that Being he would be assured of, in sincere and ardent Desires to know and feel Him; He shall in consequence of this not fail to receive more Living, more sensible and more affecting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and sensations of the existence of a Deity, then these are which he hath of his own. I am verily of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that this is the most effectual method to convince Man solidly of the Being of a GOD, that is, to oblidge them first to abandon their lusts, and then to turn their hearts towards that Being, whom in their inquiries they are pursuing, and so, sincerely make a triall, whither or not that adorable Being they doubt of, and are enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, will vouchsafe such transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently luminous and powerful, such sensibly transporting and delightful manifestations of himself, as will make them no more to doubt of his Exis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, then they can doubt that the Sun shines, when at midday, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen eyes they see his Light and feel his Warming influences. By this method the will and affections of the <hi>Atheist</hi> are gained, and I much doubt if all the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104909:133"/> Arguments we can propose to his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, without this, will be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually convictive: For as One very pertinently observes, it is not for want of Arguments that Men turn <hi>Atheists,</hi> but for want of <hi>Consideration</hi> and an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Will:</hi> The Byass which carrys them towards infidelity is not in their <hi>Ʋnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,</hi> but in their <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> It's only their partiality to their lusts that inclines them to <hi>Atheism:</hi> And the reason why they are so ready to believe that there is no GOD, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they wish in their hearts there were none. So that could the <hi>Atheist</hi> be once brought to discord with his lusts, and abandon his vices, he would then ly open to the dint and force of Arguments, and solid Reasonings might prevail with him to disclaime his former apprehensions: Whereas if he still cleaves to his lusts, and would enjoy his pleasures, without these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy stings and remorses wherewith the belief of a Deity doth imbitter and damp them, he will not fail to use all imaginable Arts to perswade, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cheat himself unto the belief of the weakness, and insufficiency of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:104909:133"/> all these Arguments that are urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
                     <p>And here it will be very seasonable to advise Parents that they speak al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes dishonourably of Atheism to their Children, that they begin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly, and betimes to beget just pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices in their hearts against so exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable a vice. Some Parents are often very zealous in byassing their Children against some indifferent, and very innocent practices, as if they were dreadfully Criminal, whilst they leave their minds at Unity with, and reconciled to the blackest Vices. I heartily wish that all Parents would direct the edge of their zeal, against these things that are unquestionably vitious, and oblidge their Children to do the same, and particularly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Atheism.</p>
                     <p>But when I speak of Atheism, I do not mean that which is too commonly understood by it: For there are some sorts of religious Sects so fond of their own opinions and practices, as to look on all that are not of their way as Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists: And to conclude that the disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, is in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ffect, the same
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104909:134"/> with the disbelieving of a GOD. This is hateful bigotry, base, selfflatery, and wretched uncharitableness. But when I speak of Atheists, I understood such as disbelieve there is a GOD, at least who pretend to do so, and really act and live as if there were none, who disclaim the great truths that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequential to the acknowedgement of His Being, such as, that there is a providence, that there are actions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecally good, and intrinsecally evil, that there is a day of Judgement, and a state of rewards and punishments after this life is over: And who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abandon themselves intirely to gratifie their flesh and senses, and take their fill of the pleasures of this World, as if these were the only felicities that our nature are capable of. This is the Atheism <hi>I</hi> would have disgraced, and which Parents should possess their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with an infinite dislike of: And if any would see this sort of Atheism ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pertinently Exposed, they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the Author I last mentioned.<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:104909:134"/> two from it, and put them in the mouths of the Parents, which they are to use for the purposes already mentioned.</p>
                     <p n="1">1st. Atheism highly reproaches the dignity of Humane nature: For were that true which the Atheist concludes for, <hi>Viz.</hi> That there is no GOD, It would follow that the nobler faculties in man, serves to no other purpose, but to render him more wretched and despicable. If there be a GOD indeed, the mentioned faculties are of excellent use, as having an object commensurate to their widest capacities, and every way fit and worthy to imploy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise them; An infinite <hi>truth</hi> for our <hi>understandings</hi> to dive into, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>good</hi> for our <hi>will</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> to pursue and imbrace: But if there be nothing to be injoyed by us, but what is carnal, and sensual; Our Noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are so far from being our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and perfection, that they are the Plagues and disgrace of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: For, for any nature to have more faculties than what are necessary to its Happiness, is <hi>monstrous;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had we nothing to enjoy but the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:104909:135"/> Happiness of Bruits; It would be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to our Natures to have the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Angels: Because these faculties would be in vain, there being no ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate object in the Nature of things to imploy and entertain them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. Atheism represents Mankind as a very Ridiculous sort of being: For there are certain affections interwoven with Humane Nature, which if there be no GOD, are shamefully ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, such as the Dread of invisible Powers, the sence of good and evil, and the anxious Expectation of a Judgement to come; All which are so deeply inlaid in our beings, as that with all our Arts and reasonings, we cannot Totally erase them. And even the Atheists themselves, who have tryed all possible wayes of extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing them, have found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the outmost they can do, is to damp and stupifie them at present: But that in despite of them, they will <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive</hi> &amp; <hi>awake</hi> again, when Death or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger approaches them; Now how ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are these affections in Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if there be no such being as a God? For upon this supposition, we have passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have no objects in the nature of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:104909:135"/> things, that have nothing in the World to move &amp; affect them, but <hi>wild Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s, <hi>flying Dragons,</hi> and <hi>Castles</hi> in the <hi>Air.</hi> And whereas all other beings have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al objects in nature, corresponding to their several instincts and affections, (For so the Hare hath a natural dread of a Dog, the Sheep of a Wolf, the Mice of a Cat, the Toad of a Spider; all the objects of which dread, have a real existance) Poor silly Man, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing there is no GOD, naturally trembles at an invisible nothing, and is horribly affraid of the Shaddow of an imagination.</p>
                     <p n="3">3ly. Atheism is very uncomfortable; For supposing that we were left destitute of God, and of Providence, and of all these blessed Supports we derive from thence, we were of all Creatures the most miserable: For in this state of things, we are compassed about with miseries and misfortunes, and (which without God is our greatest misfortune) We have a thing called <hi>Reason</hi> within our Breast, which is very ingenious in giving stings to our miseries, and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with cutting reflections on them; But it is not able to qualifie our grief
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:104909:136"/> or minister one dram of solid comfort to us. But when we lift up our eyes to God, there are such vast and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable comforts, flowing down to us, from the consideration of His Nature and Providence as are sufficient, not only to allay our sorrows, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them into Joyes and Triumphs: For in Him we behold not only an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wisdom that alwayes knows what is best for us, but also an Infinite Goodness, that alwayes wills what it knows to be so, and an Infinite Power, that alwayes does what it wills: And whilst we see and consider this, there is nothing in the World that can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen amiss to us, welcome pain, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pleasure, welcome loss, welcome gain, welcome disgrace, welcome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: For if we have but God our Friend, we may securely depend upon it, that whatever befalls us is best for us. And to add no more.</p>
                     <p n="4">4ly. Atheism is infinitly unsafe and hazardous; He who believes there is a God, and acts accordingly, runns a very small and inconsiderable venture, if in the issue of things he should chance to be mistaken: He only ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104909:136"/> the dissatisfying a few extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant lusts, the crossing some irregular inclinations of his Nature, which if he had gratified, would have vexed and tormented him, and intangled his Life with a thousand <hi>ill</hi> circumstances; He only ventures some <hi>Prayers</hi> and some <hi>Tears,</hi> some <hi>Watchings</hi> and some <hi>strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> and <hi>contentions</hi> with himself, and some <hi>reproaches</hi> and <hi>persecutions</hi> for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness Sake; In exchange for which he hath commonly a healthful and a prosperous, an even, safe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Life, and alwayes a quiet and triumphant Conscience, and a joyous Expectation of a blissfull Eternity, which do outweigh all the incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he ventures, all the pains he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, and all the pleasures of which he debars himself; And if in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion when he resigns up his breath, it appears that there is neither God, nor Heaven, nor hell, his condition will be altogether as good as the Atheists with whom he will sleep quietly in the same dust, under the same everlasting insensibility. But on the contrary, the Atheist by believing that there is no God, and acting accordingly, runns the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:104909:137"/> most desperat hazard in the World. For besides that he throws away the main support and comfort of his Life, and lays himself open to all contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and resigns up the satisfaction of a good Conscience, together with the hope of a blessed Eternity, and all the innumerable Joyes it abounds with; besides all which I say, he ventures to be eternally miserable and wretched in the World to come; In exchange for all which, he hath no other present compensation, but the pleasures of a riotous tumultuary Life, which do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes die away in the injoyment, &amp; are generally dashed and sophisticated with a thousand very sad and incomfortable circumstances. And then, if when he concludes this present Scene of Life, he should find himself mistaken in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistical confidence, and be unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly summoned to the Tribunal of that God, whose Being and Authority he hath so peremptorly denyed and affronted, and from thence be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto a dismal Eternity, there to languish out an everlasting existance in remediless woes, &amp; un-pitied lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; How could it not astonish and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:104909:137"/> confound him, to see his confident in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity baffled by such a woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when, instead of being a sleep in a state of silence and insensibility, which was the thing he depended on, he shall find himself wafted to a strange shoar, and there landed among devils and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable spirits, in a state of endless, eas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and remediless calamity. How blank and forlorn will the fool look, to find himself thus fatally mistaken? yet for all he knows, this may be the result and issue of things.</p>
                     <p>Such considerations as these, It is the interest of Parents to be acquainted with, and to take occasion to inculcate on their Children according as their capacities do advance; and as there are just grounds to fear that the infectious roots of Athiesm doth diffuse its poison, which to be sure it doth very visibly &amp; to an eminent degree in our unhappy times, though it may seem strange, that Atheism and Irreligion should be the prevailing vice, in an age wherein Religion and its interest seem to be the common ground of contention; I heartily wish that while men pretend to fight for, and quarrel about it,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:104909:138"/> they do not realy trample on its most Sacred and Inviolable <hi>Maxims,</hi> and under the specious pretexts of asserting its Rights, <hi>seek their own things,</hi> and pursue their own designes, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Atheists in their prejudices about Religion, as if it were a trick of <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> an Artifice to winde <hi>unwarry,</hi> and <hi>Credulous minds,</hi> the more easily unto obedience and subjection.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:104909:138"/> own boundless <hi>Essence:</hi> But my meaning is, that our <hi>Conceptions</hi> of GOD, how imperfect so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may otherwayes be, should be worthy of Him, and such as truely and genuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly represent some one or other of the Perfections and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of His Nature. Neither ought it to appear ridiculous (that I may obviat a Cavil of the Atheists) when we say that we may have <hi>just No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of a being that is confessedly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensihle:</hi> For as we may have a very clear Prospect of the Sea, though our Eyes be not so large as to take in its vast circumference, and truely discover and touch a huge Mountain, though we cannot enclasp it within our arms, so we may have very <hi>just notions,</hi> and discoveries of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> though our limited minds can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not span and comprehend it: Yea, this same very notion of the Divine Nature, namely, that it is <hi>Incomprehensible,</hi> is a very just one; For if it were not <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible</hi> it could not be <hi>Infinite,</hi> and if it were not <hi>Infinite</hi> it could not be <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi> But further, if the Atheist
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:104909:139"/> must needs expunge out of the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of <hi>Beings,</hi> and put wholly above the reach of our knowledge, what ever is <hi>incomprehensible,</hi> I doubt, He will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce whole Nature to a State of <hi>Nonex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,</hi> and introduce an absolute <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of every thing; For it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyably evident, that there is nothing in Nature, but what is <hi>incomprehensible</hi> to our Scantie minds. It is true, GOD is so by reason of the Super-eminency, and Inaccessible Glory of the Perfections of His Nature, which are so Vastly Disproportioned to the limited capacities of creatures; whereas, the things of Nature are so, not because (absolutely speaking) we could not know them, if the <hi>Author</hi> of Nature did vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chsafe to acquaint us with His Own Wayes and Contrivances; but because we of our selves, and by the profoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Enquiries and Penetrations of our Reason could not so dive into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Nature, as to attain any solid and certain knowledge of them; As a curious Artist could so excellently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive an Engine, as that others who are unacquainted with the Art, could never by all their own researches, come to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:104909:139"/> understand the mysteries of his contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, if himself did not make a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. The appearances of Nature then are incomprehensible to us, we cannot by means of our own faculties come to any certain knowledge of the admirable Contrivances of the Infi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitely Wise Architect of the World; But it were a very absurd inference to say, that therefore things are not at all, and cannot be known in any sense. The Loadstone is, and we know it, it attracts the Steel, and we know it likewise; But what is the secret contexture of its parts, and what are the methods of its attraction, we are as absolutely ignorant of: And the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts which Philosophers give us of these things, though they may yield us matter of entertainment, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course when we incline to be diverted, and take our Recreations; Yet I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose all that are impartial will confess, they afford us no solid and satisfying knowledge. The upshot of all is that the Incomprehensibility of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cannot be any just prejudice either against Its Existence, or against our knowing it, in such a measure as Finite
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:104909:140"/> Natures are capable of: But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume our design,</p>
                     <p>I affirm that great care must be taken to <hi>settle right Notions of the Divine Nature in the hearts of Young Ones,</hi> since if they do not conceive rightly of GOD, they cannot be said truely to know Him; For when our Apprehensions of GOD are false and undue, and such as make injurious and disagreeable Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of His <hi>Infinitely Lovely,</hi> and <hi>Adorable Essence,</hi> we do not in this case know GOD, but some Idol, to which our deceived imaginations have given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This is a matter of vast impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and must be treated of with a great dale of care and caution. <q>And, O may the Blessed and Eternal Source and Father of Divine Lights and Knowledge, so influence, order, and direct our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as that we may not assert any thing unworthie of Him, or that may in the least sullie or darken the Adorable Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of His Nature.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I suppose I need not scruple to establish it as a general and infallible rule, <hi>that these are the Justest Notions of the Divine Nature, that are most capable to make the Divinest Impressions on our Souls.</hi> For

This great Being is so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by it self, so independent of every other thing but it self, that in order to be what it is, that is to be most perfect, most luminous most intelligent, most happy, and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, it needs nothing but the only conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the only Idea, the only representation, the only Love of himself, and of his own only and most Sole Essence, to the exclusion of every other thing, that is not himself. His un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, his knowledge, his essential representation, in order to be most perfect, and to know it self as such, needs not know and consider any other thing, any other Idea, any other Nature, any other Truth but that of his own Essence. No necessity is laid on him, to think on any other thing but himself. His Love and his Affections in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:104909:142"/> order to be most perfect, and most satisfied, do not require the research and approhation of any other object, of any other Truth, of any other Goodness, but that which He is Himself without needing to go further; with this he might be and subsist eternally, in a most perfect, most luminous, most happy, and most glorious Estate, in the most secret abyss of his own Eternal Essence, where there was no Creature, or any consideration or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of Creatures, but his own only most sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and most pure Divinity.</hi> In a word no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is necessarly in God, but God Himself; all other Beings, all other Considerations, Idea's, Objects, and Truths, might never have been. Such as desire a further Deduction of this great and usefull Truth, together with the Proofs and Improvements of it, may consult the Writings last cited.</p>
                     <p>And now to be sure, The contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Divine Nature, under this view is capable to beget in intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Creatures the profoundest Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

However we must not think him to be a <hi>Fond</hi> and <hi>partial</hi> Love; which promiscuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admits all into its embraces, without regard to their qualities and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; For that would destroy the <hi>awful and reverential fear,</hi> that ought to be had of the Deity, and would make men presumptuous, and regardless of their Practices, and therefore we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he is essentially Just and Righteous, and hath assured us that he will render to every man according to his Works. But in the mean time, we must not fancie that this Justice is
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:104909:146"/> a vindictive and ill natured Quality, which delights to sport it self with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series; For in effect it is a most ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Excellency, and necessarly results from the Divine Purity and Love, For because GOD is infinitly Pure; Therefore He will admit none into the participation of His Joyes, but such as are agreeable to Him, that is in the Apostles phrase,<note place="margin">1. John 3.3.</note> Such as <hi>purify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves even as He is pure.</hi> All others, He must of necessity leave in that state of destitution and miserie, which they have freely and unchangeably chosen, and because He is Love, He cannot fail to embrace and reward all in whom he sees His Love, and His I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and whom He finds conform to His Son.</p>

They are to inform them that all the discoveries that God gives of Himself, all the <hi>Sallyes</hi> that He makes out of His own Essence, that is all the acts of His will, and all His Decrees and Constitutions; all his Works and Words, must of necessity be agreeable to, and even represent the perfections of his Nature.</p>
                     <p>GOD cannot act but as it becomes
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:104909:146"/> a God, that is, as it becomes a most Wise, most Powerfull, most Good, most Liberal, most happy, most Pure, and most Luminous Being; In a word, He must act as a Being that is Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Light and Love. The Manifes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that He vouchsafes of Himself, His Establishments and Constitutions, cannot possibly contradict His Essence, but must necessarly carrie in them the marks and impressions of His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, He cannot give a false Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to Himself and to His most amiable Nature, otherwise He should <hi>deny Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> which the Apostle assures<note place="margin">2 Tim: 2.13</note> us is not possible for him to do. From this it is easie to deduce the following very great and important Truths. 1. That whatever God hath willed, decreed, and constitute is <hi>unchangeable,</hi> and can never alter; and that because it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to His Nature, and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of His Perfections. It was indeed free and arbitrarie to God to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented His Excellencies by other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, other Natures, other Truths, then these that are now established; He needed not to have erected the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Scene of things, He was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarly
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:104909:147"/> determined to one System; Only this was necessary, that whatever sorts of Beings or Natures He would choose to constitute, they behoved to represent His Perfections; whence it follows, that the things already establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed can never be disagreeable to Him; He must necessarly be well pleased with them, seing they are the Resemblances of His Excelencies: It was His good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that they should be, and He can never will the not Being or destruction of His own pleasure. And therefore 2. The Love of God, Charity to Man, Goodness and Benignity, Truth, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Righteousness are not alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things, The Divine Nature is the pattern as well as the cause of them. For which Reason (as one well observes<note n="*" place="margin">Intel: System Pag: 20 5</note>) Virtue is defin'd to be an Assimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Deity. Justice and Honestie, are no Factitious things made by the Will any Command of the more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull to the Weaker; but they are Nature and Perfection, and descend downward to us from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Deity. 3. Whatever is repugnant and disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Divine Nature and Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is not from God, is not of His
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:104909:147"/> Establishment; whatsoever He wills &amp; decrees, whatsoever he does ought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarly to savour of the Source whence it issues, that is, must have in it the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters of His Perfections, &amp; consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whatever hath in it visibly the very contrary Characters is undoubtedly owing to another Original. Whence 4. It evidently follows, That Darkness and Impurities, Confusions and Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Wants and Imperfections, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Miseries, Death and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, in a word, sin and all its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural consequences are not, cannot be from God, cannot be the result of a <hi>Divine</hi> Decree or Establishment; For the <hi>Decree of God,</hi> is to all things a source of Perfection and beauty, of power and activity, of Purity and Glory, of Fecundity and Happiness, of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and Joyes. That infinitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable Essence cannot establish any thing, that it must necessarly disaprove and infinitly hate.</p>
                     <p>Now to be sure, these thoughts when seriously instilled in the hearts of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren betimes, are most apt to beget in them the Noble and Heavenly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:104909:148"/> lately mentioned, and which we have established as the measure of the Truth of our apprehensions; For 1. These thoughts will naturally lead them to pay the profoundest venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and respects unto the Deity, out of which they see nothing can issue but Love and Endearments, nothing but what is infinitly amiable and delightfull. 2. They will wonderfully recommend Goodness and Virtue unto them, which now they understand to be nothing else but Copies and Imitations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections. And consequently, That to be truly en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And in fine, These thoughts will represent sin unto them, under the blackest aspect they can possibly view it in, that is as infinitly contrary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant and disagreeable to the Divine Nature, will and establishments, which doubtless cannot but forcibly incline them to the greatest abhorrence of it, and keep them at the greatest distance from it.</p>

For These He delightfully viewed, and with the view of them He was infinitly satisfied in his Pure Eternity, when the Creatures were in a State of Nonexistance, and seeing His own Divine Beauties most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miably represented within Himself, in Him who is the brightness of his Glory, and the express Image of His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, He resolved in Favour of Him, and for His Sake to raise up a World of Beings, that should in different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and in different wayes, carry in them the marks and impressions of the Glories and Excellencies that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected in him, and thereby to <hi>represent himself</hi> without himself, and by so doing he saw that he would Act as became a Nature that is essentially <hi>Love</hi> and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>that is,</hi> that he should make other Beings besides himself Happy. For to create <hi>Representations</hi> of the Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, is in effect to create Glorious, Perfect and Happy Beings, since no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can truly represent them, but what doth partake of them; for imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, deformed, miserable and unhappy Beings cannot represent a most perfect, most beautiful and most happy Nature,

                     <p>O! How great an engagement to Love, Gratitude and Adoration is it to see the Essential and ever Living Source of Love and Joyes, of Light and Purities, that is, the Divine Nature, which was Infinitely and Eternally Happy in and by it self, and stood not in need of Creatures, to see it, I say, displaying its Beauties, and communicating its Riches, by the Creation of a World of Beings, and that from no other Motive, but its own overflowing, most generous and disinterressed Goodness; and for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but the <hi>Arbitrary Pleasure</hi> of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its own Perfections represented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <p>If it be said, that it were better to keep Children ignorant of these things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that their Knowledge of such false opinions, will give opportunity of frequently reflecting on them, and if they shall discover in them any thing that is taking and plausible, they will be apt to close with it; For Youth is curious, and their unexperienced Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not able to penetrate difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor to master the specious pretences that may be offered to them. It is Answered, that could Parents and the Instructers of Youth be well assured, that there are no possible ways,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:104909:155"/> whereby Children could come to the Knowledge of these false Opinions, but by their means only; I grant that it were reasonable to forbear informing them, as indeed there are many vitious practices, which it were proper to keep Children in absolute ignorance of, could it be well done. But since these erroneous conceits are abroad in the World, since they have abettors and defenders, that propagat and spread and recommend them, I judge that it is great P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Could I on good grounds perswade my self, that when the plague rages in a Countrey, my Child would never come near the places where it prevails, or though he did, that he is in no danger of being infected, in this case, <hi>I</hi> might both spare my self and him the trouble of giving him cautions: But if I be certainly assured that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry possible for him, to approach the places, and to converse with the Persons that are infected, and that the contagion may

                     <p>But in the mean time, I do not think it necessary, that the same caution and warriness be used with respect to all Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, even though they be false; For there are a great many <hi>Speculations</hi> wherewith the World hath been troubled and embroiled, that are of every little moment, and that, as on the one hand, it is very hard to determine on which side the Truth lyes, so on the other the Salvation of Souls, and the true interests of Religion are very little concerned in the decision. We must take our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the importance of Opinions, from the Good or bad influence they neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarly have on our Hearts and Lives, so that these Opinions that necessarly and visibly tend to the destruction of the Practice of Piety and Vertue, that effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diminish if not extinguish the Love and Reverence, the Duty and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage we owe to GOD, can be never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough baffled and discredited: And of this sort I take these that follow to be.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The first <hi>misapprehension</hi> of GOD, I shall take notice of, is that pernicious one of <hi>Spinoza,</hi> who owns no <hi>other God</hi>

The Author indeed is very subtile, but I humbly think not so much in his Metaphysical thoughts as in his fraudulent dealing; For he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally retains the common wayes of Speaking, but in a sense different from all Mankind. He will tell you that God is, that He <hi>necessarly exists,</hi> that He is <hi>Eternal,</hi> that He is <hi>Infinite in Power and Knowledge;</hi> but under those expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, he couches thoughts that flatly contradict what he would seem to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish, and destroyes downright the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions that Men have of these things; For whereas all the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of GOD as a singular and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Being distinct from the Universe, whereof he is the Maker and Governour, as a Being that is infinitly perfect and and happy in and by himself, and that necessarly and essentially possesses all i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable Excellencies, Our Author understands nothing by all the Glorious Forms of Speech that he uses, but the <hi>Ʋ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse or Nature.</hi> The being of Nature
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:104909:156"/> is the Being of GOD; the Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodness of Nature, is the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, wisdom, and goodness of GOD; or to deliver his Mind if possible more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all the <hi>particular Beings</hi> of the Universe considered and united under one general Notion of <hi>Being,</hi> is that <hi>Notional Being,</hi> which he attributes unto GOD. For in effect, <hi>Spinoza</hi> acknowledges no GOD as distinct from the Universe, but a general abstract Notion of <hi>Being,</hi> formed by our intellects, and which hath no real existence without our minds, much like <hi>Ʋniversale</hi> among the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, which is a general Idea formed by our minds, from the consideration of many particulars, agreeing in the same nature and properties, and which may be equally affirmed of all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, but hath no real existence of its own distinct from these; thô in <hi>Spinoza's</hi> Language, the several particulars may be considered as the mods of this general <hi>Idea.</hi> It is in this sense that <hi>Spinoza</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes <hi>Being to GOD,</hi> or in no sense at all; For (1) he will not allow any <hi>singular individual Being distinct from Nature to be actually existent,</hi> Tho this be that which all the World understands, when GOD
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:104909:157"/> is spoken of. Neither (2) will he allow <hi>that GOD is this or that Beeing in particular,</hi> and consequently there remains nothing but that general abstract notion of Being, which hath no existence but in our minds, to be attributed unto GOD. And as the Being which he gives his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Deitie, is notional and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, so are also the excellencies of <hi>Power, Wisdom, Knowledge,</hi> &amp;c, that he ascribes to it. Thus, for instance, the Power of all the particular Beings of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, considered under an abstract notion of <hi>Power,</hi> is the Power of GOD; the Knowledge of all the Particular Beings of the Universe, considered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one general Notion of Knowledge, in the Knowledge of GOD; and so of the rest: For our Author will not allow his Deitie to have any singular individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Excellencies of its own, distinct from these of the particular Beings of Nature; the generall abstract Notions of them, being sufficient in his account to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a God. But pray what is this but under the vizard of good and promising Words, to introduce the blackest <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism?</hi> But perhaps it will be said, that our Author asserts all the particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:104909:157"/> of the Universe to be Modes of the <hi>Divine Substance,</hi> and therefore the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Substance really exists; For since these Mods or Modifications are real and actually existent, they must suppose a real and actually existent Substance; For a substance that hath no real and actuall existence cannot be really and actually modified. This will not mend the matter, but rather give us opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of discovering greater and greater absurdities. The Truth is, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors disquisitions about <hi>Substanee,</hi> its Attributes, and <hi>Modifications,</hi> are so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, indistinct, and odd, that it is very hard to pick up any tolerable sense out of them, and the best we can hit on is very absurd. His thoughts in short are these, if I may pretend to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him, (1.) That there is but one only Substance which he sayes is GOD. (2) That this one Substance hath two Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Attributes; to wit, Extention &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation. (3) That all particular Beings are not Substances, but Mods of that Substance which he calls Divine. These Assertions certainly will sound very odd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Ears of such as are absolute strangers to them; Let us reflect a little on them.</p>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:104909:158"/>
                     <p>And (1.) I ask if this one Substance be the same with the Substance of the Universe, or a Substance different from it? The latter our Author will not say; For it would over turn his whole Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis. But then, if this one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance be the same with the Substance of the Universe, I ask in what sense is it one, and in what sense hath it Cogitation and Extention? Hath it a singular individual Oneness distinct from the particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Universe? hath it a Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Extention peculiar to it self, and different from the Extentions and Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of particular Beings? This our Author will not say, neither indeed can he. For it is plain that all the Substance of the Universe is (to speak in his own dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) actually and particularly modify'd, and that there is no Cogitation or Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that of particular Beings, whence it evidently follows, that the one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance he so much talks of, with its Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of Extention and Cogitation, are nothing else but general and abstract Ideas formed by the mind, and which hath no real existence without it.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) Our Authors Assertion that all particular Beings are not Substances but
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:104909:158"/> Mods of the Divine Substance is very senseless. For (1) Pray what are the Mods of a Substance but the Substance it self modify'd? Or the Substance put in such or such a dress, and must it cease to be a Substance because it hath got a particular dress: I doubt all <hi>Spinoza</hi>'s Mathematical Quirks will perswade but a very few; That Men, Beasts, Trees, Stones, great Mountains are not substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but Modes. (2) Modes are acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental to a substance, and do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute its essence, and therefore though all the particular Modes of a substance were quite destroyed or Annihilate, yet we Conceive very well that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance might <hi>Exist still:</hi> But on supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that all the particular Beings of the Universe were Annihilate, I would fain know what would become of <hi>Spinoz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a</hi>'s <hi>Divine substance.</hi> (3) From our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Doctrine of Modes, it follows, that not only Insects, Flees, Speeders, Lice, and Venemous beasts, Toades, Serpents Vipers, but also that all the Criminal and Villanous cogitations of the wickedest Creatures; the Incestuous, Murtherers, perjured, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> are Modes of the Divine substance. Whether <hi>Spinoza</hi>
                        <pb n="244" facs="tcp:104909:159"/> or his favourites will think this an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity I cannot tell: Only I am sure these are no very Beautyful dresses for the <hi>Divine substance</hi> to be in.</p>
                     <p>There is yet a specious pretence made use of, to identifie and confound GOD and Nature; And it is this, GOD is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in Power, And therefore all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Power must be Really, and Actually Lodged in him, and possessed by him: For if a Power did Actually exist, which were not his, his Power would be limited, and so it would not be Infinit, And consequently the Power of Nature must be Actually the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of GOD, or the Power of GOD must be actually finite, since a Power is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be actually existing, that is not his.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:104909:159"/> Creation of the World he hath received no accessions but the Arbitrary pleasure of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Excellencies mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested and displayed without himself. It is the not attending to, or rather blotting out these Natural and Genuine Notions of a Deity, that hath led <hi>Spinoza</hi> into all his fatal mistakes. The Truth is, it is the Opinion that I oppose, that limites and reproaches the Power of GOD; For it seems very strange to grant that the Power of GOD is infinite, and yet to deny that this infinite Power can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, in a Finite Measure, Power and Activity to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Beings: Infinit Power can never be exhausted, and therefore I cannot see but if it pleased, it might be eternally communicating new Powers and Activities without any Diminution of it, or Disparag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it, nay not to be
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:104909:160"/> able to do this, would be very disagreeable to it, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting of it, as Weakness. And besides, this communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Power may still be said to be the Power of GOD; And that, 1, Because it is Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from Him, and by His Donation. And, 2, Because it is subordinate to Him, and under His Conduct, and the influences of His Good Providence. And herein I think the famous <hi>Malbranche</hi> hath sadly faultred, and hath made too near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to Spinozism, when he denys the <hi>Activity</hi> of <hi>Second causes,</hi> and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts that they are only occasional ones, and that at the presence of them GOD works immediatly and by Himself. So for instance, the fire doth not burn, but GOD at the presence of the Fire; The Sun doth not enlighten the World, but GOD at the presence of the Sun doth it. This conceit is very involved, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with terrible consequences, and insurmountable difficulties. The Author grants that GOD communicats Being to the Creatures, and a Being distinct from His own. Now if he can, and does

                     <p n="2">2, Another false apprehension con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning GOD is, when Men conceive of Him, as an <hi>Arbitrary Omnipotent Will,</hi> That acts as if He were not essentially Good and Just, Pure and True.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:104909:161"/> Him to have issued out of Him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self, by the Production of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Essences, Beings, Truths and Goodnesses different from himself; it was arbitrary to him, by what sorts of Natures and Beings he should represent his own excellencies, whether by these already established or by others. But on supposition that he willed to act without himself, he could not but Act suitable to the infinite perfections of his Nature. To do otherwayes is not Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary to him. GOD must act in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner worthy of himself, that is, as becomes a most luminous, most good, most Happy and Glorious Essence: But a great many have conceived of GOD under the Notion of an Arbitrary and Powerful Will, which is not determined in its actings by the goodness and Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness, the truth and purity, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lovely qualities of his Nature. This thought in my opinion greatly sullies the Beauty of the Deity, and if I mis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>take not, hath been the source of several very dangerous errors in Divinity.

                        </gap>ivine Things savingly, it will be needful in the next place, that I tell Parents what they must with all possible seriousness, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to their Children, to the end they
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:104909:180"/> may receive the Holy Spirit and be taught by him. But before the Parents proceed to tell them what to do on this Occasion, it will be very proper to suggest two things to their Consideration, for their Incouragement. (1.) That to be taught by the Holy Spirit, may be the Happiness of all; For none are exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it, but these who by a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed carelesness in seeking it, or willful opposition to it do exclude themselves. The Promise is general, <hi>He will give his Holy Spirit to them that seek him,</hi> that is, to <hi>every one</hi> without exception of any, but of such as make themselves uncapable of him, by <hi>resisting, grieving,</hi> and <hi>quenching</hi> him. The Promises of GOD, as they are generous, so they are sincere, He truely means as he speaks, so that none need fear that they are secretly or fatally excepted from sharing in the Blessings promised. To all that heartily perform the Condition, the Promises shall be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually fullfilled, and none are depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Blessing, but such as by a will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful continuance in sin, and pertinacious resistance of Grace refuse to accept of it. (2.) That this benign Spirit doth prevent all our endeavours and desires, and by
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:104909:180"/> his Gracious Influences and Motions doth awaken and quicken us, and inspire us with Strength, whereby we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to prepare for him a Lasting and Permanent Residence in our Souls; For when we have listened unto, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with these inward Calls and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he comes and takes possession of us, and dwells in us as in his living Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and then it is that we are Divinely Illuminated &amp; Taught: Of this the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> doth assure us.<note n="*" place="margin">Prov: 8.4. and 1.23.</note>
                        <hi>Ʋnto you, O men I call, &amp; my voice is to the sons of men — turn at my reproof:</hi> These are the preventing Calls of the Holy Spirit which quicken, Excite and Strengthen us; And if we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey these loving Opportunities, and improve the Strength communicated unto us, for these ends and purposes for which it was designed, that is, in turning away from sin, in abandoning, renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and crucifying our lusts and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yeelding our selves unto <hi>God,</hi> we are assured of more liberal Effusions, &amp; consequently of a more intimate &amp; <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding</hi> Presence of the Holy Spirit; whereby we shall be Divinely taught and instructed; For so it follows, — <hi>Behold I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:104909:181"/> make known my Words unto you.</hi> So that we see the pretence of weakness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability is fully taken away; For the Holy Spirit solicits, excites and moves us, and secretly inspires us with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Force: And why should we complain of weakness that hath so powerful an Assistant? And who is so Gracious as to make the first attacque on us? For if he did not this, not a good thought, not a pious Motion would ever spring up in out dark and corrupt hearts: And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, here is a great Incouragement to Diligence and Fidelity afforded us, For the more Faithfully we correspond unto the Motions and Calls of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the more Conscientiously we improve the Strength communicated unto us by his preventing Influences, the more full possession he gets of us, and the more plentifully he imparts his Light, and Joys, and Graces unto us. <hi>Ʋnto every one that hath,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Mat: 25.29.</note> that is, that hath made a good use of, and diligently improven the preventing Graces of the Holy Spirit, <hi>shall be given, and he shall have abundance.</hi> His Diligence and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity shall be rewarded with great and more plentiful measures of them.</p>

                     <p>Now in Order to receive the Holy Spirit, so as he may become the blessed <hi>Inhabitant</hi> of our <hi>Souls,</hi> and Divinely il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate and teach us, we must,</p>
                     <p n="1">1st. <hi>Empty our Souls of all corrupt lusts and passions,</hi> and of every motion and inclination that are disagreeable to him; For the Holy Spirit cannot dwell in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Hearts; he may indeed, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually doth visite wicked men with the gracious designes of awakening them out of their sinful slumbers, urging and importuning them to their duties, and assisting in the discharge of them, but <hi>take up his residence in them, and abide with them he cannot: For what fellowship can light have with darkness?</hi> How incongruous as well as imposible is it, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of purities and joyes, of love and peace, of Unity and Harmony, of sweetness and benignity, should be strictly united to, familiarly converse with, and constantly dwell in Souls, that are sensual and Earthly, Wrathful and Furious, Revengful and Malicious, Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and Uneasie, Sour, Disordered, and Melancholly: These things are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the one to the other, and cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly sort together.

                        <hi>The Spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature is the devils element, and its passions and inclinations (hightned and improven by his diabolical inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) are the engines that he makes use of to push it foreward to all kinds of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies.<note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet: 2.21.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us that they were <hi>Holy Men that were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi> Its only in a pure Mind that this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Guest doth lodge. <hi>The secret of the LORD,</hi> sayth <hi>Solomon,</hi>

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:104909:184"/> how is it possible for him to teach us? a Scholar that will not give ear to the instructtions of his Master, can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come learned, or be a good proficient.

                        <hi>For I will speak of excellent things, and the opening of</hi> my <hi>lips shall be right things,</hi> clearly intimating that in order to be taught by the Holy Spirit, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him the knowledge of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things, we must carefully listen to his voice, our attention must be close and recollected, and therefore we must Piously retire and withdraw from all these objects and exercises that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:104909:185"/> are apt to distract and divert us. Now as a Scholar, if, when his Master is speaking and using endeavours to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct him, he should suffer his attention to be broken and scattered by carelessness, by playing and unseasonably talking with his Comerads, or otherwayes, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hear the voice of his Teacher, nor be benefited by him; So neither can we hear the Voice of the Holy Spirit, nor receive any profit from his Loving Cares to instruct us, as long as our minds are distracted, and our attention diverted by the cares and concerns of the World, by the tumults of our unruly passions, by inordinatly pleasing our sensuality, and indulging our selves the liberty of speculating vainly. His gentle Voice is heard only in Silence and Recollection, when the Mind is Serious and Indistur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, our passions hush't, and the World secluded.</p>
                     <p>But here we are to remark, that the Holy Spirit speaks to us both Outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Inwardly. <hi>Outwardly,</hi> when by his gracious Care, Appointment, and Direction, some Objects are presented to our outward Senses that may put us in mind of our Duties, and move and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:104909:185"/> us to the performance of them, that as so many streams, though distant, may lead us to the very source of Life, and Light and Joyes, and that <hi>in fine,</hi> by working on our Senses and inferiour Faculties, may excite and awaken the Diviner and more Noble Ones. For the Truth is, Mankind, since their degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie and aversion from GOD, are so sunk into flesh and sense, are become so gross and stupid, and so insensible to these things that are purely Spiritual, and so incapable of the exercise of the Diviner Faculties, that it is necessary their outward man he attacqued, and their Inferiour Powers, their senses and imagination wrought on, that by means of these they may be made to turn <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and listen to that Divine Voice that speaks within them, and resign themselves unto its Conduct and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
                     <p>Now these Objects by which the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> speaks to us from without. Are (1.) And espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Scriptures</hi>

To such as are in a <hi>state of sin and impenitency,</hi> These he solicits and importunes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn by inward Motions and Impressions, by suggesting good Thoughts, and prompting to pious resolutions, by checks and Controlls, by conviction of sin and duty, sometimes by frights and terrours, and other whiles by Love and Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                        <hi>resist the Holy Ghost,</hi> whereby their condition becomes very deplorable, and their Conversion very difficult; For the more Men resist the Importunitys, and stiffle the Motions of the Holy Spirit, the stronger do the chains of their corruption and servitude become.

                  <p>From what I have thus briefly Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, it easily appears, that, the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> why <hi>I</hi> prefix <hi>your Names</hi> to the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Performance was, not only that <hi>I</hi> might give a <hi>publick Testimony</hi> of the <hi>great</hi> and very <hi>Sincere</hi> Respects, which <hi>I Secretly</hi> intertain as well for your <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> as for your <hi>Honourable Character</hi> and <hi>Faculty;</hi> But also that I might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak your <hi>Protection</hi> against the <hi>Assaults</hi> of the <hi>Injurious,</hi> not doubting but your Generous Inclinations, to Favour and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the interests of <hi>Truth</hi> &amp; <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> will prompt you to cast a Friendly look on this <hi>Little Tract,</hi> in which, after you have Vouchaf'd it a serious <hi>Perusal.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104909:197"/> I</hi> am Hopeful, you will find Nothing but what Realy Contributs to the Promoveal of a <hi>Truely Christian Piety.</hi> It is true indeed, though the matters whereof I Treat in this <hi>Essay</hi> be great and <hi>Noble,</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> of all <hi>Acceptation,</hi> yet I must confess that the <hi>Defectivness</hi> and <hi>Unaccuracies</hi> of the <hi>Managment</hi> may render it a present, very <hi>Unsuitable</hi> to Persons of so <hi>Polite a Judgement,</hi> as all the world know those of your <hi>Faculty</hi> to be, whose Appearances, even when <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary,</hi> are as <hi>severely elaborat</hi> as these Composures which have been the <hi>res<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sult</hi> of <hi>Thought</hi> and <hi>Meditation.</hi> But I was soon reliev'd against the <hi>Uneasienes</hi> of this Reflextion by Considering; That <hi>great Minds</hi> have a Proportionable <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> and that therefore as you can quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discover a defect, so you can as speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Pardon</hi> and cover it, especialy when it is not such as toutches the <hi>Essence</hi> of the Subject treated of. Besides, I Concluded that the <hi>Sincere Love</hi> which you have for the <hi>Great things</hi> of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104909:197"/> would incline you to put a just <hi>Value</hi> on them, even when they are not set off with all the <hi>Advantages</hi> that the <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Delicat</hi> would require. It will not in the Judgement of the <hi>Sagacious</hi> and Discerning, <hi>Lessen</hi> the value of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Jewell,</hi> that it is presented to them in a <hi>Rag,</hi> nor do we vilify a Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aine <hi>Restorative,</hi> because it is conveyed to us in a coarser Vehicle. They are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly things of Inestimable Value, <hi>Truths</hi> more Precious than Rubies, and of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er efficacie than the most Fam'd <hi>Antidots,</hi> that I here set before you, and which under your <hi>Countenance</hi> and <hi>Patrocinie.</hi> I adventure to Publish to the World, and therefore the ruder dress, in which they appeare ought not to <hi>Disparage</hi> them in the Opinion of the <hi>Judicious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It cannot but Extreamly afflict all that yet Retain any <hi>Measures</hi> of seriousness, to see the <hi>Reputation</hi> of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> so dreadfully Sunk, as it is in this very <hi>Corrupt Age;</hi> to see those who have been solemnly Initiated into it, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104909:198"/> brought up under it, Prophanely <hi>Deride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> its Venerable <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and even making Total Apostacy from it, and <hi>Blaspheming</hi> that <hi>Worthy Name, by the which they are called.</hi> A <hi>Villany</hi> so prodigiously Aggravated, that it <hi>Out-does</hi> the Wickedness of <hi>Devils.</hi> Two things, I conceive, have especially Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to this Mischief; One is, the <hi>False Notions</hi> which People have Form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to themselves of this Holy and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Religion; The other is, the <hi>Shameful Disagreebleness</hi> of the <hi>Lives</hi> of those who profess it to its <hi>Sacred Rules,</hi> their Discovering a <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Temper,</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> quite contrary to those which it Enjoyns and Requires, and in the mean time perswading themselves that they are <hi>Christians good enough,</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, And both those are mutual Causes to one another; For as on the one Hand. <hi>False</hi> or <hi>Defective</hi> Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Designs</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> do open a <hi>Door</hi> to <hi>Vitious Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> and Practices; So on the other,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104909:198"/> the <hi>Love</hi> which Men have to their Lusts, disposes them so to Mould <hi>Religion,</hi> and to <hi>Gloss</hi> its Precepts after such a manner, as that all the <hi>Appetits</hi> of their Flesh and Blood, and Corruption may be Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and indulged without needing to fear, that for all this, they Violate the <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> or cross its <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,</hi> or that there is any danger of their coming short of the <hi>Glories</hi> of the other World. And as those <hi>Inauspicious Twins</hi> do thus <hi>Reciprocally</hi> influence and Cause each other, so they jointly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr to <hi>dishonour</hi> and <hi>expose</hi> the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion;</hi> For it is very plain, I think, That when <hi>False Notions</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd concerning it, when it's <hi>great Designs</hi> are <hi>mistaken,</hi> its most <hi>Essential Truths</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> are overlook't and Disreguarded, and the <hi>Stress</hi> of it laid on things of very <hi>small Moment,</hi> when some <hi>little Opinions, some Forms</hi> and <hi>Circumstances,</hi> are not only set on the same <hi>Levell</hi> with its most <hi>indispensable Maximes,</hi> but also more zealously <hi>Assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104909:203"/> this <hi>little present</hi> I presume to offer you <hi>Aimes</hi> at; and therefore I Adventure <hi>Humbly</hi> to <hi>Intreat,</hi> not only that you would accept of it as a <hi>Mark</hi> of that <hi>Undissembled Affection</hi> I have for you, but also that, since the <hi>Advantages</hi> of it, if any such shall attend the Peruseing it, were not intended to be limited to you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but that by <hi>your Means</hi> it might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the more <hi>universally useful,</hi> you would <hi>Vouchsafe</hi> to take it into <hi>your protection;</hi> For, as I know that the more <hi>extensive</hi> and <hi>unconfined</hi> the <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie consequences</hi> of any <hi>project</hi> may be, the more highly you will <hi>Value</hi> and <hi>prize</hi> it; So, I assure my self, that next to the <hi>Divine Blessing,</hi> without which all our Endeavours will prove unsuccessful, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can more effectually entaile the Character of being <hi>Universally benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> on this <hi>Performance,</hi> or make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with greater <hi>acceptableness</hi> in the World, than your <hi>Countenance</hi> and <hi>Favour.</hi> Let me be allowed to tell the <hi>Truth</hi> without needing to fear that I shal
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104909:204"/> incur the <hi>censure</hi> of being a <hi>Flatterer</hi> for so doing, unless from the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Malice.</hi> For when Persons of <hi>solid Judgment</hi> and deep <hi>Penetration,</hi> of excellent <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Unbyassed</hi> Spirits, all which none without doing you <hi>Palpable Unjustice</hi> can deny to be your <hi>Just character;</hi> Shall <hi>own</hi> and <hi>approve</hi> the <hi>Advices</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> which are here tendered, and the excellent <hi>Truths</hi> insisted on in Prosecution of them, as this will <hi>exceedingly recommend</hi> them to the <hi>Candid</hi> and <hi>Ingenuous,</hi> so it will either entirely <hi>prevent</hi> the unkind <hi>Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms</hi> of the less <hi>Judicious,</hi> who should be ashamed to disparage these things, which have got the <hi>Approbation</hi> of such as are <hi>more Competent</hi> to Determine of their <hi>value;</hi> or else make their <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,</hi> if they shall think fit to pass any to be but <hi>very little</hi> reguarded.</p>
                  <p>And here before I close, I must beg leave to tell you that one of the best <hi>uses</hi> you can make of <hi>these great Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> which GOD hath bestowed on you,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104909:204"/> is to imploy them in <hi>asserting</hi> the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion,</hi> and these <hi>incomparable Doctrines</hi> which it proposes. As your doing this becomes very Seasonable <hi>now,</hi> when the <hi>little witts</hi> of the <hi>Age</hi> imploy all the <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Skill</hi> they are Masters of to <hi>disparage</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Religion,</hi> which hath such <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> of Truth on its side as ought to give entire <hi>Satisfaction</hi> unto all who do not wilfully shut their eyes; So it will be very much your <hi>Honour,</hi> for this is the <hi>Noblest Cause</hi> you can Possibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the <hi>Patrocinie</hi> of. The <hi>Cause</hi> I intend is the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with its <hi>great</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> Truths and Duties, and not the <hi>petty</hi> interests and <hi>opinions</hi> of this and that and the other <hi>partie,</hi> which are but <hi>Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible</hi> Triffles in Comparison, Tho some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Obtruded on the World under very sacred and Venerable Names.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Holy Jesus, the ever Blessed and Infallible <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>excellent Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> hath assured us, That, when he <hi>comes in the Glory of his Father with the Holy Angels,</hi> he will <hi>confer</hi> very <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>eminent marks</hi> of his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> on such as <hi>shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed either of Him or His words in an Adulterous</hi> and <hi>sinfull Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Alas, it is but too plain that those <hi>Epithets are proper</hi> enough to <hi>Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erize</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:104909:206"/> the Age in which we live, wherein there is so visible and so <hi>woful</hi> a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacie</hi> from the Christian Life and Spirit, and the <hi>Maxims</hi> of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> have <hi>so</hi> got <hi>the Ascendant</hi> and are in <hi>such Vogue</hi> and Reputation, that to lead a Life according no the <hi>Rules</hi> of the Gospel, and the <hi>Maxims of the Cross</hi> is to <hi>expose</hi> One's Self to <hi>contempt</hi> and derision. Now in <hi>such a juncture</hi> as this, to <hi>appear</hi> in behalf of Christianity not only by <hi>asserting</hi> its Truths, but also by <hi>strictly obeying</hi> its precepts, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Noble,</hi> and as it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly evidences, that one is <hi>not ashamed</hi> of the <hi>words</hi> of the Son of <hi>GOD,</hi> so it is the most <hi>effectual Method</hi> to reclaim the <hi>Enemies</hi> of Piety, and is such a generous <hi>instance</hi> of Love and Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our Redeemer as he will he <hi>mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleased</hi> with, &amp; which he will not fail singularly to reward, when he comes to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to every man according to his works.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Christian Religion</hi> hath indeed a great many <hi>Adversaries,</hi> who appear against it under different Forms, <hi>Some</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:104909:207"/> deny its <hi>Truth,</hi> and are so <hi>Blasphemous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly insolent</hi> as to put it in the same rank with the <hi>Impostures</hi> of Mahomet. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>insult</hi> over &amp; <hi>redicule</hi> its Sacred <hi>Mysteries.</hi> A third sort <hi>gloss away</hi> its precepts in favours of <hi>their old man</hi> and corruptions. But perhaps the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Christians</hi> are its most <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>fatal</hi> Enemies; Those, I mean, whose <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi> are <hi>Diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally opposit</hi> to its Spirit and <hi>designs,</hi> even while they <hi>acknowledge</hi> it to be true and profess to believe, that it is from GOD. It is certain that <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> particularly <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Self-love,</hi> are the <hi>Source</hi> of <hi>Errours, unholy</hi> hearts make <hi>unsound</hi> and <hi>giddie</hi> heads. It is the <hi>blind Love</hi> which Men have to their <hi>Lusts</hi> that gives them a <hi>disgust</hi> of Christianity, because it obliges them to deal a <hi>little severely</hi> by their <hi>dear flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and to do <hi>violence</hi> to their Vitious <hi>but beloved</hi> inclinations, and this <hi>dislike</hi> gradually advances till at last, it <hi>Issues</hi> either into
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104909:207"/> a <hi>total Apostacie</hi> from it, or else into formeing such <hi>Schemes</hi> of it as will <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> all the appetites of <hi>Corrupt Nature,</hi> So that, doubtless, tho <hi>surest Fence</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all <hi>Pernicious Errours</hi> is a <hi>pure Heart</hi> and <hi>Holy life;</hi> And therefore one of the <hi>greatest kindnesses</hi> we can shew to <hi>Religion,</hi> and the most <hi>Signal instance</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> we can do to the Souls of Men, is to Labour by all means Possible to <hi>Reclaim</hi> the Vitious and the Prophane, and the Nominal profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors to a <hi>truely Christian</hi> Life and Practice.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:104909:212"/> Wonders of <hi>Love, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendencie.</hi> Here <hi>Love</hi> appears in its most <hi>unparallel'd</hi> heights, <hi>Grace</hi> in its Unsearchable Riches, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendencie</hi> in Circumstances, that at once both <hi>Endear</hi> and <hi>Astonish.</hi> Here are Depths of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which thô they surpass our <hi>Comprehension,</hi> yet they afford a Delightfull Prospect, whereon to imploy our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and whereby to Excite our <hi>Devotion.</hi> Here there are such <hi>Noble Excesses</hi> of Bountie, if I may be allowed so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign them, as are very proper both to Kindle and Entertain our <hi>Love,</hi> and to raise it up even unto <hi>Rapture</hi> and <hi>Transport.</hi> Here the Divine <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropie</hi> overflows, and comes in a Dress which equally wins and amazes; For the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> towards <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> did from the Beginning Manifest it self in Methods that were very Oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet this instance of it, Namely That <hi>He who was in the Form of GOD,</hi> should take on him the <hi>Form of</hi>

                     <p>This, I mean, the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Son pf <hi>GOD,</hi> was the other Great <hi>Mystery,</hi> which, in Prosecution of my Defign, I promised to insist on: And it cannot be denyed, but it is the indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable Duty of all Chrictian Parents to instill the Knowledge of it into their Children very earely, and with all <hi>possible care,</hi> that so they may be Taught to <hi>Remember</hi> not only their <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi> but their <hi>Redeemer</hi> also <hi>in the days of their Youth;</hi> For it is very certain, that nothing can be more proper to Season young Hearts, nothing can more effectualy gain them to an early Piety, than Displaying unto them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Beauties of this Lovely and Venerable Mysterie, and seriously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them with the precious Truths that are Comprehended in it, the great Duties to which it Engages, and the powerfull Motives by which it inforces the Belief of the one, and the practice of the other. And this being vifibly
<pb facs="tcp:104909:213"/> a matter of vast Importance, I shall con-contribute the best <hi>Assistance</hi> I can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Parents, and others concerned, in Directing them to the <hi>exactest Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> I know, of Communicating unto the Youth the Knowledge of this very Momentuous particular.</p>
                     <p>And because the Knowledge of our <hi>Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> as <hi>manifested in the Flesh,</hi> includes also the knowledge of the <hi>grcat Things</hi> of the Christian Religion, whereof People commonly have not <hi>very just</hi> apprehensions, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that in directing to the Measures of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating this Knowledge, I should give a <hi>true account</hi> of several very great Truths and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and rescue them from these False and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Glosses which flatter the Lusts of Men and under specious pretences, <hi>Evacuat</hi> the <hi>designs</hi> of the Gospell. This will oblige me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large Considerably on some heads; But then I am hopefull, That, as will appear in our Progress, nothing shall be advanced, but what is highly Edifying and Instructive, and which it is the Interest, as well as the duty of all Ages to be duely informed of, and constantiy to practice; as they would wish one day to be admitted into the Biiss and Glories of the

Neither was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Man neeessary to GOD, in order to prosecute his design of having creatures to whom he might communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his fulness, and with whom he might Eternally delight himself: For it was easie for him to accomplish this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign by raising up of new myriades of free and intelligent Creatures in the room of Man, which might be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his bounty and delight.

Upon these infinitly Meritorious, and Charitable Addresses and Intercessions of the Son of GOD, to which nothing could be denyed, GOD was prevailed with to resume thoughts of Love towards man, to pass by his demerit, and cast a favourable eye upon him, and to do and give whatever might contribute to the restoration of him, and because the Incarnation of his Son was the great

Now it is plain, That to save Man, is to restore him to the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifick Fruition of the Presence of GOD, which he had forfeited; For, till he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at this, he cannot be properly said to be saved; And as he advanees towards it, so proportionablie his Salvation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. And therefore when our LORD sayes that <hi>He came to save man,</hi> it is all one as to tell us, that he came to restore him to his Primitive Bless. But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that Man can be capable of the immediat Fruition of this Bless, while in a state of Corruption and sin, and destitute of Rectitude and Purity; For Light can have no fellowship with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, GOD cannot dwell in, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat the pure Emanations of his
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:104909:220"/> Light and Love to a Soul that is habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally impute and polluted, and disaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him; Or on supposition that he did display his amiable Rayes in such a Soul, they would be so far from being an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to it, that in effect, by reason of its indisposition, and disconformity to Divine Things, they would be a plague and terrour to it. And therefore as the Son of GOD came to restore Man to his Primitive happiness, so he came to qualifie and prepare him for it, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminating sin, and introducing Purity and Innocence into his Soul. The Account which the Angel gives to <hi>Daniel</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> of the design of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Son of GOD, doth fully verifie this, which was in short, <hi>to finish Trangression, to make an end of sin, &amp; to make Reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in Everlasting Righteousness.</hi> To this same purpose, is that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tit: 2.14.</note>
                        <hi>He gave Himself for us, that He might Redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto Himself a peculiar people Zealous of Good Works.</hi> This is also the Beloved Disciples account of it, for this purpose (saith he)<note n="*" place="margin">1 Ep. 3.8.</note>
                        <hi>Was the Son of GOD manifested, that he might destroy
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:104909:220"/> the works of the devil;</hi> That is, All sin and Corruption, all sorts of Impurities, whether of the flesh or of the Spirit, all inordinate Lusts and Passions, all wicked acts and habits, which are called <hi>the works of the devil,</hi> because he was the first Author and Source of them, practises them himself, and sollicites all that he can to the practice of them. These works which the devil had seduced Mankind to love, &amp; do, &amp; whereby he had defiled and corrupted the Humane Nature, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it unsuitable to GOD, these works, I say, the Son of GOD, being <hi>sent in the Likeness of sinfull flesh,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8 3.</note> came to root out and destroy, and to make man par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of a <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and Inclinations, and so fit and prepare him for the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifick Vision and Fruition of GOD. From this great and weighty Truth, there do naturally issue two very edifie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and instructive inferences, which can never be enough inculcated on the hearts of Children.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is, That then the Son of GOD came not into the World, with design to countenance or <hi>give any indulgence unto sin,</hi> No, He came as we have heard, to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:104909:221"/> make an end of it, <hi>to finish it, and to destroy it;</hi> He came not to palliat and cloak it, but to discover and expose it in its own black and horrid forms; Not to lessen the Obligations to disclaim and hate it, but to increase and heighten them. The Compassionat <hi>Jesus</hi> will be mercifull to the Sinner, when he turns a sincere Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, but he will never be reconciled to the sin; And therefore let none per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niciously imagine, that because they are or may fancie themselves to be the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of GOD, the Elect or Pardoned and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied persons,</hi> therefore that sin is more tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable in them, then in the impenitent and Unbelievers, or that GOD hates it less in them than he doth in others. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this were to reproach and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the holyness of GOD, as if he did not hate sin as sin; Doubtless, wherever it is, it carries in it an equal contrariety to the purity of his Essence, and when he sees it in any of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he cannot choose but hate it the more, because it is committed against a clearer Light, more endearing instances of Love, greater Obligations and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and a longer Experience of the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:104909:221"/> sweetnesses of Religion than others have, so that to take encouragement to sin from the Mercies of the Gospel, is visibly to turn the Grace of GOD into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to contradict, and as much as in them lyes, to defeat the great design of the Incarnation of the Son of GOD.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other inference is, That the Son of GOD came not to procure Heaven, but to such only as should be <hi>qualified and prepared</hi> for it. He designs it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously for all, without any regard to their Dispositions. No certainly; For Heaven is a State of Purity, of Light, of Love and of Divine Joys, and none are capable of the enjoyments of it, but such as have attained to a Pure and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Divine temper of Soul. It is true, all would be Infinitly welcome to partake in the Happyness of Heaven, if all were qualified for it. None are fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excluded from it. GOD the ever Blessed Father of Mankind design'd it as the Portion and Inheritance of all his Children; And therefore he hath indued them with great and Noble Faculties, to fit them for so great and so Divine an enjoyment. The Truth is these vast
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:104909:222"/> and immortal <hi>desires after an Infinite good</hi> that are naturally seated, and do burn in the Hearts of all Men, do necessarly suppose both that all Men are capable of an infinit good, and that an Infinit good was designed for all as their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and Bless; For to say that all men do desire an Infinit good, and yet to deny that they have capacities for it, or to allow that they have desires after it, and <hi>Capacities</hi> for it, and yet to affirm that GOD hath absolutly determined that in the far greatest part of them, these desires should never be satisfied, nor these Capacitys fill'd with the Objects, for the Fruition of which, these desires and Capacities were implanted by GOD in man, are thoughts so absurd and inconsistent, so unworthy of that GOD, who is Essential, Infinit, and most Communicative <hi>Love and Goodness,</hi> so dishonourable to his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Truth and Justice, And, if they did practically obtain, so suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of our desires, and so great discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to our hopes, and endeavours after happiness, that none who impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consider things, can seriously admit of them. It is certain, that if all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:104909:222"/> had continued in Innocence and Purity, and the love of GOD, all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, had been actually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the fruition of the Bless and Glories of Eternity. But now that they are become degenerat &amp; sinful Creatures, and have contracted Dispositions contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to GOD and Divine things, it is not possible that they can be admitted into the presence of GOD, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of his joys, until what is Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Earthly, impure and perverse in them be perfectly done away; until their disaffectedness and aversion to God be removed, their vitious habits rooted out, and a temper agreeable to Divine things introduced in their Souls. Whence it is evident, that one of the greatest services we can do to the Souls of Young Ones, is, with all the diligence we are capable of, to Imprint very early on their Hearts this most important and most fundamental Truth, &amp; to acquaint them with these passages of Scripture that press and recommend it, such as are these that tell us, <hi>that they</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>These and many the like passages do very solidly prove, that Heaven is design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the portion only of Purified and Holy Souls. And this Doctrine, if young Ones were seriously trained up under the impressions of it, could not choose but have very excellent and singular influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences on their hearts and lives, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their falling into a great many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious mistakes, which are the source of Spiritual negligence and carelesness, &amp; the grounds of false &amp; presumptuous hopes of Heaven; Particulary it would</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="331" facs="tcp:104909:223"/>1. Convince them of the indispensible necessity of Holiness, That it is no arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary or indifferent thing, but an essential pre-requisite, in order to partake in the Felicities of the other world; For in effect Holyness is the health &amp; good temper of the Soul, by which it is put in an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat capacity of enjoying &amp; relishing the pleasures of Heaven; And indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, Heaven cannot be a state of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to any: For a Soul that is habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally impure, earthly and sensual, hath given such a wretched turn and byass to its faculties, that nothing can savour with it, but what suits its perverse dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, that is, nothing but what is Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and earthly; and though such a Soul were admitted into Heaven, yet it would be miserable and unhappy still, because there is nothing in that Blessed place that could gratifie its corrupted appetites. The enjoyments of Heaven are pure and Spiritual and Sublime; And these to be sure cannot give satisfaction and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a Soul that is corrupt, and sunk into earthlyness and sensuality, and is under the power of vile Lusts and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but rather would torment, and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:104909:224"/> plague it, and that because of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety and aversion that is in its temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to GOD and Divine things; For, as the light of the Sun, which affords vast pleasure and delight to a sound and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous eye, is infinitly uneasie and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome to an eye that is tender and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered, Even so the Light and Joys of GOD, which to a pure and well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Soul are unmeasurably satisfying, and the sources of Eternal and Glorious delights, do unspeakably frighten and disquiet a perverted and defiled Soul.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Doctrine will let them see that no vain and presumptuous relyances on the Merits and Satisfaction of our Blessed Saviour, no imaginary pretences of being the peculiar and bosome favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Heaven, no perswasion that we are pardoned persons, and the adopted Children of GOD, can excuse the want of <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Inherent Purity,</hi> for the Holy GOD will owne none for his Favorites, neither will he adopt any as his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but such<note n="a" place="margin">Rom: 8.29.</note> as are conformed unto the Image of his Son; That is, such as by the powerful Operations of the Divine Grace, in the Exercise of an
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:104909:224"/> universal self Denyal, and severe Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification have attained to a State of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Nor are any pardoned so as to have a Title to Eternal Life, but they only who heartily<note n="b" place="margin">Acts 3.19.</note> repent, and are sincerely <hi>Converted,</hi> who forsake their sins, and reform their Hearts and Lives. And it is a horrid and profane abuse of the Merits of our dear Redeemer, to look upon them only as <hi>appologies for our habitual impurities,</hi> and as a cloak to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liat our beloved wickedness, and to hope that on the account of them, we shall be charmed into Heaven, though sin and lust live in us, and we continue to gratify all the appetites of the <hi>old man,</hi> when in the mean time, we are assured by<note n="c" place="margin">1 Joh: 3.5.</note> one who understood well the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of his incarnation, <hi>That he was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested to take away our sins,</hi> and that by really implanting <hi>in our Souls an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteousness,</hi> and thereby to conform us unto GOD, and to dispose us for the Fruition of the <hi>Pleasures that are at his Right hand for ever more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. From this moreover they may be taught very easily to deduce, that the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of their Souls,</hi> ought to be their
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:104909:225"/> great and principal Work, while they are in this World. We see that it is not possible for us to be admitted into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that is, to enjoy the glorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Communications of GOD in the other World, as long as we are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and corrupt; And therefore, The great Business of our Lives, must be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously to labour to arrive at a State of Purity and Agreeablenes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to GOD. And this Blessed State we can never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to, if we do not constantly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and entirely resign our selves unto the Influences and Operations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, and by the Mighty Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of it, strenuously contend to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify corrupt nature, to resist and check all its appetites and inclinations, to root out our vitious habits, and watchfully to prevent the contracting of new ones, that so our Souls, being emptied of sin and self and corruption, may be filled with the Fruits of the Holy Spirit, with these Graces that are the true Ornaments of our immortal part, and which make us agreeable to GOD, <hi>as having Christ formed in us.</hi> This is the greatest Concern, this is the <hi>one thing needful,</hi> that we must
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:104909:225"/> be travelling about as long as we are in the state of tryal. The sooner we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in it, the better it will be for us, and the longer we delay, the less inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we shall be to enter upon it, and the more hard and difficult we shall find our work to be. This, it is the indispensable duty of the Instructers of Youth, to make all under their care very sensible of; And in order thereto, to remind them, that they are the off-spring of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Parents, that they came into this World, with degenerat and defiled natures, prone to evil, and disaffected to Good, that they began very early to give indications of their degeneracy and corruption, and have sinn'd against the Will and Laws, the Light and Love of GOD their Father, against the motions &amp; importunities of the Holy Spirit their Sanctifier, and against the Blood and Wounds, the Grace and Merits of their dear Redeemer, and that therefore they must nail their old Man to the cross, That is, check and oppose and control it in all its desires, and with Fervour and Perseverance, implore the healing Efficacies of the Divine Grace, for the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:104909:226"/> restoration of their Souls. That they must begin this Work with all the speed imaginable, by devoting the Prime and Flower and Vigour of their years into it, and continue it without weariness and interruption, as long as they are in this World. And the more effectually to perswade them to it, it will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to represent unto them, that this is the design of that solemn Injunction<note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor: 7.1,</note> of the Apostle, <hi>Having therefore all these Promises</hi> (namely these mentioned in the 16 and 18 verses of the preceeding chapter, whereby GOD assures us that he will gloriously inhabit our Souls as his living Temples, and fill all our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities with his Light and Joyes, treat us as his dear Children, and bestow u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon us the noble Inheritances he hath prepared for us) <hi>let us</hi> (to the end we may be capable of such ineffable Favours) <hi>cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the flesh</hi> (from the grosser and more visible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities, such as are <hi>drunkenness, gluttony, furnication, adultery,</hi> in a word, all bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and brutal lusts and excesses) and (not only so, but also from all) <hi>filthiness of the spirit,</hi> from pride and self love, from
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:104909:226"/> Covetousness and Injustice, from Malice and Envy, from Lying &amp; Hypocrisie, from Bitterness and Revenge, and the like more Spiritual and more Diabolical Vices) <hi>perfecting Holieness in the fear of GOD.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Infine, This Doctrine will dispose them to undergo with cheerfulness and pleasure whatever <hi>may tend to the promov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all &amp; perfection of the work of their Purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> how disagreeable &amp; unacceptable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be to the palat and relish of their Old Man; For when once Young Ones are truely in Love with Heaven, that is in Effect, with GOD, whose Light and Joyes and Communications do constitute Heaven, they cannot choose but be in Love with Purity, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares and qualifies them to partake in the Bliss of it, and being in Love with Purity they will consequently to be sure, Love whatever may contribute to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess and rid their Souls of all vitious Defilements, and to re-implant in them that Purity and Rectitude of temper which they so highly and so justly value, and therefore Self denyal and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the Cross and Afflictions, Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Sorrowings and Spiritual Desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:104909:227"/> and in one word all the Difficulties and roughnesses of the <hi>Narrow way that leadeth unto Life,</hi> though they be unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory to the gust of the Old-Man, yet they are very agreeable to these Souls that are in Love with Purity, as being well assured that they have a singular influence on the rooting out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of their Corrupt Natures; Just as a Patient that is very Fond of his Health will, with a deal of Cheerfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, submitt to the cures that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed him by a skillfull and charitable Phycitian, though they be made of very bitter and sharp ingredients. But this Matter will afterwards fall under consideration.</p>

Having thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with the Ends of the Incarnation of the Son of <hi>God,</hi> and with the Consequences that naturally issue from the Consideration of them, it will will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to let them moreover under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what the Blessed <hi>Measures were which our Redeemer did take, in order to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass the Gracious Design of Restoring Man to

                        <hi>First, His Merites,</hi> Man having by his Voluntary and disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genous Revolt, and Apostacy from GOD, rendred himself unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of His Favour, and forfeited his Light and Grace, and thereby having become a corrupt and defil'd Creature, it was not possible that he could either <hi>Merite</hi> or even <hi>Desire</hi> the Recovery of his forefeited Bliss, for good Desires cannot spring out of a Soul that is wholly void of GOD; neither can a Rebel and sinfull Creature merite; and therefore in order to restore Man to the Favour of <hi>God,</hi> and to recover unto Man that Light and Grace, which by his sin he
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:104909:228"/> had forefeited, and without which he could not be saved. It was necessary that One Infinitly Worthy in Himself, and infinitly dear to <hi>God,</hi> should inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose with <hi>God</hi> in the behalf of Man. And accordingly the <hi>Holy Jesus,</hi> the Son of <hi>God,</hi> and the Son of Man in one Mysterious Person, being to uhed on the one Hand with a wonderfull Zeal for <hi>God</hi> His Father, &amp; on the other with incomparable Charity for His Brethren, the Children of Men, and vehemently desiring that <hi>God</hi> should be again Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and Honoured, Loved and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed by Men, and that Men should be made partakers of the Joyes and Happiness of <hi>God,</hi> became the<note place="margin">1 Tim: 2.5.</note>
                        <hi>Mediator between</hi> God <hi>and Man,</hi> and so pleaded with <hi>God</hi> for Men, and presented Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be their Saviour, professing how infinitly willing He was to do whatever was necessary to turn them to the Love of <hi>God,</hi> from self &amp; sin &amp; Creatures, &amp; thereby to bring them to Bliss and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, thô it were even to lay aside his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for some time, and put on the Veil of their Mortal Nature, and plunge himself in their Miseries. Now to be sure the Addresses presented to GOD by
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:104909:229"/> dear a Person, and in such moving Strains, that were attended with a Zeal so ardent, and a Charity so vast, could not choose but be infinitly meritorious in themselves, and most agreeable to him, and to which he would refuse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and thereupon <hi>God</hi> for the Sake of His well Beloved Son, granted Man the pardon of his Sin, renewed the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Light and Grace, in order to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie and cleanse his Soul, and afforded him all the Means and Assistances that were necessary to engage and enable him to return to the Love of <hi>God,</hi> and so to restore him to the Happiness and Bliss which he had lost; And moreover when these Rebel Creatures Men, had generally abused these Favours, and by their continued Resistances of the Holy Spirit, and their love of self and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had rendred the Means that were afforded them fruitless,<note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 5.2.3 4. &amp;c.</note> When they had sunk themselves into Flesh and sense and had contracted more inveterat ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of wickedness, and thereby had run into a new score of Guilt and Demerite, then the great and final Remedy must be put in Execution.

                     <p n="1">1 The first Blissing I shall mention is <hi>Pardon,</hi> by which GOD passes over the Guilt and Demerit of the Sins of Men, and in consequence of this bestows on them such good things as their present circumstances will admitt of, and gives them a right and Tittle to other and greater Blissings, providing that they Faithfully perform the Conditions that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104909:230"/> are necessary in order to be qualified &amp; disposed for the Enjoyment of them, and that we ow this favour to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Redeemer; we are frequently assured by St. paul. <hi>In whom (that is in Christ,) we have</hi>

Of this pardon the Apostle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently speaks in these words,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor: 5, 19.</note>
                        <hi>GOD was in Christ reconeiling the World to himself,

                        <hi>giving Rain from Heaven and fruitfull Seasons, and filling the Hearts of Men with Food and Gladness,</hi> and much more the actual collating of the offers and means of Grace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, must necessarly suppose reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Pardon in some sort; For to say that GOD gives the Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his goodness to men, and yet is in no sense reconciled to them, nor hath Pardoned them, is very absurd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent. Now this General Pardon hath been <hi>absolutely merited,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to any thing done or to be done by Men. But then we are to Remember that this Pardon doth not give any a Tittle or immediat right to Eternal Life, for if Men continue impenitent and unreformed, they will be certainly Damned for all this. The consequence of this Pardon, as hath been already intimated, is the bestowing on Men the common Effects of GODS Goodness, and the Offers and Means of Grace and Salvation, as also a right to
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:104909:231"/> be admitted to <hi>Repentance,</hi> providing they speedily and seriously ingage in it while the time of Tryal is continued, and the day of Grace lasts, for if once that Blissed Period be over, their right to be admitted to Repentance will cease for ever.</p>
                     <p>The particular Pardon respects parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons, and it is that by which GOD passes over and remits the guilt and demerit of all their by past Sins, and treats with them, as if they had never Sinned, of which we have a remarkable instance in the parable of the Prodigal<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 15.20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</note> and the consequences of this Pardon are that GOD bestows on them that are thus Pardoned his Holy Spirit and Divine Graces, Operats in them, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, Enlightens, and Regenerats them, takes up his Residence in their Souls, owns them as his Children, declares them Immediatly Capable of Eternal Life, gives them a right to inherit it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the joyfull foretastes of it, and in end actually and fully collates it upon them. Now that we may know the Manner how this <hi>Pardon</hi> is merited, we most view it in the <hi>Offer</hi> and in the <hi>Application</hi> of it. The <hi>Offer</hi> of it is <hi>absolute</hi>

But in the mean time, a Soul that is capable to discern and relish <hi>Divine Things,</hi> will discover in the <hi>plain Discourses</hi> of our <hi>Saviour, Strains</hi> of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> that excel in Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siveness and Efficacie, the Eloquence and Oratorie that the World is fond of, as much as the hight of the Sun, when in its <hi>Meridian Glory,</hi> excels
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:104909:248"/> in Light, and warmth the fainter twincklings of the distant Starrs; Though on the other hand it is true that a Heart, which, by being ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated to the Mods and Wayes of speaking that the Learned and Eloquent are wont to admire, is become carnally delicat, cannot be touched with any thing but what is set off with Quaintness and Accura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and will not notice so much the Matter, how Heavenly and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine so ever it may be, as the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing dress in which it is put. Now from the whole it evidently follows, 1. That we ought not to examine the Discourses of our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or of those that are acted by His Spirit, according to the Rules of Humane Arts and Sciences, or to conclude of their Excellency from their Conformity or Disconformity to these; Alace! vain Men are apt to imagin that what things they have bigg thoughts of, GOD ought
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:104909:249"/> to account of them at the same rate, whereas in effect, as our LORD tells us,<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 16.15.</note>
                        <hi>These things that are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteemed amongst Men, are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in the sight of GOD.</hi> 2. That it is an impious vanity to attempt to come to the true and solid Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of our Saviour's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, by considering in what Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the Words and Phrases used by Him, are taken in Humane Authors, who thought and spoke and wrote according to the spirit of the corrupt world, as if forsooth they must have had the same <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>Thoughts</hi> that the <hi>Lamb</hi> of GOD had, when He uttered these Words; For I think it is abundantly evident, that though we may discern a lameness and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidency in their words, yet if we do not discover the like in their Ideas, we cannot Justly conclude that we have the Mind of CHRIST, when we think we have got the true sense of our Classick Authors;
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:104909:249"/> And I suppose it will be hard to say that <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> had the same Ideas and Designs that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had, when they happened to use the same Words in their Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that He did in His Heavenly Discourses. Not that I deny but Critical Observations are of very great use, and even necessary; For instance, in the translation of the Sacred Writtings, from the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Languages into other Tongues, and for discovering some superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial truths, concerning Histories, Customes, and such other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. However, it is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>Fervent Prayers</hi> for the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> together with a sincere disposition to <hi>Obedience,</hi> are the only <hi>Keys</hi> that can unlock Our SAVIOUR's Discourses, and lead us to the Living and Solid Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of them. Such as would see this Matter Piously and Accuratly discussed and cleared,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:104909:250"/> may consult the Writtings to which I referr<note n="*" place="margin">Oecon Divin: Tom <hi>4</hi> Cap: <hi>4</hi> de erud: <hi>P: 180.</hi>
                        </note> in the Margent. But we will be obliged more particularly to insist on this, when we come to recommend the Holy Scriptures in general▪ and to declare with what Views we are to peruse Them, and what are the true Means of arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the solid Understanding of Them. 3. That it is a disparageing of Divine Truth, to put it in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and pompous dress of Words and Phrases. The gaudie attire of an harlot doth not sute the Modesty of a Grave and Chast Virgine. Error and falshood have need of some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious ornaments to set them off, but Truth needs nothing to commend it to all Candid and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Hearts, but its own Nature, Beauty, and Comliness. Mean while we must take care that under pretence of keeping at a distance from the inticeing words of Mans Wisdom, we do not degenerat into a
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:104909:250"/> mean flatness, and affect such sordid wayes of speaking, such absurd compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons and similitudes, as are capable to beget in us any other passions, rather than Gravity, Reverence, and Devotion. Though our Blessed Saviour put His Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses in a plain and simple Dress, yet He used no forms of speaking that were mean and abject. All His Phrases and Parables were grave and sober, and well choosen, &amp; excellently accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat to convey the Heavenly Doctrines He delivered into the Hearts of all that were well disposed, so that we are told,<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 4.22.</note>

                     <p>From all it appears how great a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour we do to Youth, when we teach them not to despise plainness and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Stile, but rather highly to love and value it, and to nauseat towering and affected Rhetorications, as being visibly the offspring of pride and vain glory, and designed as much to set off the Writer or Speaker, as the Truths that he pretends to recommend; For by this means we dispose them to fall in love with, and to prize the Discourses and Writings of Divinely inspired
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:104909:251"/> Persons, and not to quarrel with them, though they do not find them to be so rigidly coherent, so methodically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, nor put in such florid dresses, as those composures are, that are fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the rules of Humane Arts and Sciences, and so we guard them against one of the common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices that prophane and Atheistical minds entertain against the <hi>Sacred Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</hi> For these Gentlemen do cavil at and reproach the inspired Volumn, because they find it is not written after the manner that Humane Composures are, as if foresooth the Blessed GOD Himself were obliged to conform to the measures that the blind and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted reason of Man invits and prescribes?

                        <hi>But He that sent Me is True, and I speak to the World those Things that I have heard of Him.</hi> The Doctrines that He delivered, were not the Fruits of His Laborious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searches into the accurat Composures of the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> nor the Consequences of His Reasoning and Speculations, or of His Converses with the Learned Sages of that Age; No; but they were the immediat Dictats of that<note n="c" place="margin">Isa: 61.1.</note> adore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Spirit, <hi>That anointed Him to speak glad Tydings to the Meek.</hi> Now to be sure the serious Inculcating the Divinity of our
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:104909:253"/> Saviour's Doctrine on the Hearts of Young Ones, the careful and frequent representing unto them, that the Words spoken by Him, were the Words of GOD Himself, and that they are still to be received as such, cannot choose but be very beneficial unto them; For the Natural Result of this will be 1. To beget in them a <hi>Great Love</hi> to it, and a <hi>Just Veneration</hi> for it; For they will be easily sensible that what is certainly <hi>Divine,</hi> merits that the highest Value should be put upon it: The Doctrine which they believe to come from GOD, needs nothing else to recommend it to them, but that it is His; This is inducement enough to engage their Love and Regard; For whatever derives from the source of Light and Love, cannot but be very Lovely and agreeable. And when they are thus gained to bear a great Love to, and to have a high Esteem for the Doctrine of the Holy Jesus, it will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to obey it, and conform un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: It was the Royal Psalmist's viewing the Word or Law of GOD as Divine; <hi>That is,</hi> as coming from GOD, and bearing the Mark and Impressions
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:104909:253"/> of His Wisdom and Goodness, of His Righteousness and Purity, that made Him vent Himself in these Affectionat Strains concerning it, that run all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longst that Heavenly Summary of His Devotions, I mean the 119 Psalm, and particularly in that Rapturous Passage of it,<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 119.97:</note>

I confess indeed, that since this Heavenly Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine hath by the endeavours of the Learned, been digested into Systems of Divinity, as they are called, it hath altered its aspect, and lost its lovely Shapes, its <hi>Simplicity</hi> is spoiled, and its <hi>Misterys</hi> prophaned, by suiting them to the <hi>Barbarisms</hi> of the Schools, its Truths are subtilized out of the view and reach of the Simple, and its Duties rendered unintelligible and impracticable, by slie and cunning distinctions invented by the <hi>Old Man,</hi> and intended to secure his lusts, and to excuse from walking in the <hi>Narrow Way,</hi> pointed out by the precepts of the Gospel. So that now Divinity is become a thorny and puzl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Science, a Theater of Controversies, and a Ball of Contention, tossed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the angrie and irreconcilable Sects. Under pretence of resolving dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultys, they have multiplied them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly, and in stead of illustrating, they have darkned and intangled things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes in themselves very clear.

                           </note> as a Heavenly Soul well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, despised to appear in the World, in the quality of a subtile Philosopher, an Eloquent Orator, a lofty Disputer, a great and fam'd Doctor, and of one considerable and recommended by the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Learning and Wisdom, He contented himself to converse among Men in Humility and Truth, in Simplicity and Meekness, pointing with all possible plainness at the Way of Truth, by a Life fruitful in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Miracles. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as He was in effect the Wisdom of GOD the Father, the LORD of Sciences, the Creator and Inspirer of the Prophets, He might easily, if He had thought fit, have imployed the subtilitys of all the Sciences and discovered their most hidden Secrets, with all the Advantages and Lusture of a vast and profound spirit, and so have procured Himself Honour. But so far was it from this, that He choose to speak the Truth after so
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:104909:257"/> simple a manner, that well near all looked on Him, not only as a mean Person and unlearned, but also as a mad man and a fool; And, which is yet worse, as a blasphemer: And thus He carryed with design to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest unto us the true and simple way which we ought to hold, and how much it is our duty to avoid the magnifying of our selves, and being puffed up under pretext either of Wisdom or of Science?</q> It will be evident unto all who seriously consider the Life and Doctrine of our Saviour, that this observe is solidly founded. But alace! this Admirable Conduct of His is now inverted, and Men think fitt to stear their course by other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures then He did. It were extreamly to be wished, that these celebrated Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who have imployed so much of their time in composing <hi>Systems</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, had spent it in exemplifying to the World the Life and Power of the Gospel Doctrine, and that in stead of digesting it into accurrat and methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Treatises, they had digested their own Hearts and Lives according to the Divine Maxims of it; For certainly a
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:104909:257"/> vast number of Holy Examples, would have benefited the World more than a prodigious multitude of Theological Books.</p>
                     <p>But when I assert that <hi>Simplicity</hi> is one of the Characters of the Doctrine of the Blessed JESUS, I intend not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Mysteries</hi> from it; Certainly He delivered a great many misterious Truths in His Heavenly Discourses: But then these are proposed with so great simplicity, that none who are truely serious, and duely qualified to entertain them, are barred access to them. <hi>They</hi>

                     <p>But to return to our design, from the consideration of the simplicity of our Saviours Doctrine, Parents and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structors of Youth may take occasion to engage them. 1. To love <hi>plain and simple Doctrines,</hi> and not to despise things easie and obvious, providing they be Edifying and Instructive, and tend to the promoveal of solid and substantial Piety.

The Doctrine of the Cross appeared mean and contemptible in their Eyes, they thought it a degrading of their Understandings, to notice such follies as they fancied the unlearned Apostles presented to them. There are still (even in the Christian World) but too

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:104909:261"/> he Prayes and Praises without the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Devotion of the Heart, if he reads without sincere resolutions to Obey, if he Fasts without Penitential Contrition, and gives Alms without Charity and Compassion; All this is of no account with the Searcher of Hearts. Further, Tho one does not actually take away the Life of his Neighbour, tho he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from grosser practices of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet as long as he retains rancor and malice in his Heart, and inwardly cherishes impure and villanous inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his outward abstinences do not clear him from guilt, he is still for all this before GOD, reputed a murtherer and unclean. Hence it is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi>

Indeed it is our <hi>outward man</hi> alone that falls under the jurisdiction of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns of the World, and it is to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that they can give Laws, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is only for the Deportments of

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:104909:262"/> Man,</hi> to the Laws and Government of Jesus Christ, they cannot pass for his true Subjects, nor can His Kingdom be set up within them.

                     <p n="2">2. That they be carefully informed, that the <hi>Performances</hi> of the <hi>outward man,</hi> when they are not accompanied with the Affections of the Inward, cannot be acceptable to their Saviour, how speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous so ever they may appear in the
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:104909:262"/> eyes of the World. These are but triffling and superficial services, and come not up to the designs of a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law, which requires the Inward and Vital Conformity of the Heart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they are but lean oblations, and sacrifices without Life, that disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their Redeemer, and set Him off with the dead carkass of obedience. These meerly outward exercises, can never be sufficiently enough exposed and disgraced to Young Ones; And yet it is very often the misfortune of their Education, that they are very early taught to put too great a value on these shaddowary appearances of Piety; Their Instructors commonly are satisfied, if they can get them to discharge the visible part of their duty, to read the Holy Scriptures, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and to pray vocally, without taking care to engage their Hearts, which cannot but prove a ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="4">4. I affirm that the Doctrine of our Blessed Saviour is <hi>Practical;</hi> This is a very remarkable property of it, and ought not to be slightly passed over: Great
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:104909:263"/> Care must be taken to imprint it very deeply on the Hearts of the Youth, as being a Matter of unspeakable Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Certainly it hath proven very fatal to Religion and the Souls of Men, that this View of the <hi>Christian Doctrine</hi> hath been so lamentably eclipsed under very wretched and delusive pretences. It will, I perswade my self, be beyond controversie with all, who have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Doctrine of our ever Blessed Redeemer, as it is represented to us in the Gospels, without being byassed by the guileful and confounding infusions of the <hi>contentious divinity,</hi> that it was not his intention to entertain Mankind with subtile speculations, or to fill their heads with air and notion, and such embarassing stuffs as the Schools have fished out of the Holy Scriptures, have cannonized for Divine Truths, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed as Articles of Faith, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, under pain of damnation, as the infallible Oracles of GOD, which, in effect, are generally nothing else but the spurious issue of dark and prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat minds. It is plain our Blessed Lord had no such thing as this in His View; He came for far more Noble Purposes,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:104909:263"/> He came to reform the World, and to root out vice and sin, to introduce a Living Piety, and a Solid Vertue, to discover unto Mankind the Way to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, and to oblige them to walk in it. And in order to accomplish these worthie Ends, so becoming His Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and His Charity, He gave the most excellent Rules, the most winning Motives, and the most powerful As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances for Holy Living that ever the World heard of.

He tells His Disciples, in a passage of His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sermon<note n="a" place="margin">Mat: 6.17.</note> on the Mount, That <hi>He came not to destroy the Law, but to fill it up,</hi> or perfect it, <hi>That is,</hi> He came not to discharge Men from any part of their Duty, to give any libertys to sin, to call Men to lesser measures of Purity or Perfection, than the <hi>Jews</hi> of old were obliged to; No, to be sure, it is the very contrair, He came to assert and reinforce with new Sanctions, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Divine Law, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Eternal Rules of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to rescue it from the false and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful comments of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi> to introduce into it new precepts that were not known under the former Dispensations; Such as is, for instance, the Imitation of Him as our Pattern, which, to be sure, could not be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory before his Appearance in our mortal nature, and giving us an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.

<pb n="423" facs="tcp:104909:264"/> to raise us up to the highest pitches of Perfection and Purity that Humane Nature is capable of in this State of frailty and imperfection. And at the close of this admirable Sermon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in He gives the summarie of our holy Religion, He shuts up all in these words <hi>Whosoever heareth these Sayings of mine, and doth them,</hi>

                        <hi>I will liken him to a Wise Man that built his House upon a Rock;</hi> Which is an intimation plain enough, that the Doctrines he had been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them were Practical, and that it was the Reformation of the Hearts and Lives of Men, that he intended in all that he delivered. In effect, our LORD did but very seldom insist on points of Speculation, in His Discourses to His Disciples or the People, and these of this Nature that He touched on, were such as presently resolved into Practice. As for instance, when He had informed the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Jo: 4.24.</note>
                        <hi>That GOD is a Spirit,</hi> which is a Point of <hi>Theorie,</hi> He presently makes a practical improvement of it, telling her, That <hi>they who Worship Him, must Worship Him in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> In short, I dare undertake, that our
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:104909:265"/> LORD never delivered any Head of Doctrine that was purely Speculative, and went no further, but that all the Truths He recommended to His Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were such as issued either into a Rule of Holy Living, or a Motive to inforce it.</p>
                     <p>Now, The Consequences that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally result from what hath been said on this Head, are very Momentuous, and the Youth must be obliged care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to Note and Remember them. They are these,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Since the Doctrine of our Blessed Saviour is <hi>Practical,</hi> it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That <hi>He intends it should be Obeyed.</hi> I cannot imagine what other End the Delivering Doctrines of this Nature to the World, can be rationally supposed to aim at but this. Is it only that they might be known? Alas! The most part of People stop here, and go no further; They think they do enough, if they attain to the Knowledge of their Duty. But our LORD tells us, That if our Knowledge do not issue into O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, it will, serve us in little stead; <hi>If ye know these things, happy are ye</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Jo: 13.17.</note>
                        <hi>if you do them:</hi> Nay, He moreover
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:104909:265"/> assures us, That <hi>He who knoweth his Master's Will,</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 12 47.</note>
                        <hi>and doth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.</hi> So far will the knowledge of our duty be from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing any thing effectually to our Happiness, that it will really aggravat our misery, when it is not improven into Practice. Or shall we say, That the end of such Doctrine is to inform Men of their Duty, and thereby to convince them of their weakness and unability to Obey, That upon this Conviction, they may have recourse to another for Righteousness. Now, how specious soever this pretence may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be, yet without doubt, it is one of the shameful subterfuges of the <hi>old man,</hi> one of these false and pernicious glosses that he hath found out, in order to evacuat and disannul the Precepts of the Gospel, that they may not prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie to his lusts, and that he may have some imaginarie grounds to flatter himself with hopes of Heaven. St. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed sayes, <hi>That</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Rom: 3.20.</note>
                        <hi>by the Law is the knowledge of sin;</hi> And certainly, giving Laws and Rules of Life, prohibitions of sin, and Precepts of Duty, do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently suppose, that there are disorders
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:104909:266"/> to be redressed, and a want of Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that must be reintroduced, and hence the same Apostle teaches, <hi>That the Law was</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim: 1.9.</note>
                        <hi>not made for the Righteous, but for the lawless and disobedient,</hi> and else where, <hi>That</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Gal: 3.19.</note>
                        <hi>it was added because of transgressions;</hi> For had Man continued Innocent, doubtsess he had been under no other Law but that of <hi>Love;</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a degenerat Creature, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen into darkness and disorders, and lost the right Path, it was necessary that the wayes by which he strayed from the Great and Original Law of his Creation, should be pointed out to him, and that he should be taught how to return to it again; In a word, That a Law should be given him, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with his sin and his Duty. Let it be granted then, that one design of a Law under every Dispensation, is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of our miscarriages, and to let us see what we ought to be. But what of this? must we stick here? no to be sure; For these Notices that are given us by the Law, were intended not only to let us see, <hi>What we ought to be,</hi> but also <hi>what indispensibly we must be,</hi> and accordingly, St <hi>Paul</hi> expresly teaches,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:104909:266"/>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Rom: 8.4.</note>
                        <hi>That the Righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in them that believe,</hi> I say, <hi>fulfilled in them reallie and inherentlie,</hi> by having it written in their Hearts, and copied out in their Lives, or by the living conformity of their whole Man to it, so that <hi>They do no more walk after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</hi> But how is this done? not indeed by the Law it self; For it, as such, only informs Men of their sin and Duty, but furnishes them with no strength; Neither by any power in Man, for he is but corruption and weakness, but only by the Powerful Grace of Jesus Christ manifested in the Gospel, and which alwayes accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Doctrines of it; For the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Law is not a dead letter, or a naked declaration of sin and duty, but is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the Spirit and Force of our Redeemer; Which, when admitted into the Heart, transcribes there in living and real Characters the outward letter of the Gospel. Hence Christians are said<note n="b" place="margin">Rom: 6.14.</note> to be <hi>not under the Law, but under Grace;</hi> That is, not under a weak inefficacious <hi>Pedagogie,</hi> such as was that of <hi>Moses,</hi> but under the Gospel Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, which is the <hi>Ministration of
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:104909:267"/> the Spirit,</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor: 3.8.</note> And furnishes with power and ability to fulfil all that it requires; Wherefore we must not look on the Precepts of our Holy Religion, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as evidences or indications of the disorders of our minds, but also as Cures impregnated with a Divine Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue for redressing them, and must deal by them as a languishing Patient would do by the Remedies prescribed to him by a Skilful and Charitable Physician; <hi>That is,</hi> We must apply them, which we do, when we put them in practice; For a sincere and persevering Obedience is the very Application that is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and such as will infallibly issue in our Cure.</p>
                     <p>But let it be moreover granted that the Law, and even the Gospel it self, doth convince us of our inability to Obey. But what then? doth not the Gospel also convince us of the<note n="b" place="margin">Eph: 1.19.</note>
                        <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Greatness of the Power</hi> of that Grace which exerts its force <hi>in them that believe?</hi> 'Tis true indeed, we are fallen and corrupted Creatures, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come both disaffected and unable to do good, but then the <hi>Divine Grace</hi> merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us by Jesus Christ, and offered
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:104909:267"/> to us in the Gospel, relieves our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; And, when it hath got access in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>all the good pleasure of his Goodness, and the Work of Faith with Power.</hi> So that now we have no ground to pretend our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, and thereby to excuse our selves from obeying the Precepts of our Holy Religion, but rather it is our duty to take courage, and to believe with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that<note n="b" place="margin">Phil: 4 13.</note>
                        <hi>we can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth us.</hi> In fine, we shall heartily grant, that we must have recourse to another for Righteousness; For it is very certain, that the righteousness which we spin out of our own bowels, and is meerly the effect of our own natural abilities and endeavours, without the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> is of no value, cannot render us agreeable to GOD, nor qualifie us for being admitted into His presence; In this Sense it is very true, That<note n="c" place="margin">Isa: 64.6.</note>
                        <hi>all our Righteousnesses are as filthy rags;</hi> So that it is indispensably necessarie that we seek for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in another, even in Him who is <hi>the LORD our Righteousness, who hath
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:104909:268"/> brought in everlasting Righteousness, and who of GOD is made unto us Righteousness and Sanctification</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor: 1.30.</note>; But then we must not think that the Righteousness which we receive from Him is a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness entirely without us, we must not conceive of it as a plaister to cover our sores, or as an apologie for our wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness and vicious dispositions, so that for its sake, tho we be otherwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently and habitually impure and unholy, we become immediatly cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of entering upon the <hi>Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> Certainly to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain such thoughts as these, is disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to our Holy Religion, and to teach them for Truths, would be sadly to misrepresent and pervert the Designs of the Gospel. Without doubt, that Righteousness which the Holy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus communicats to His Members, is a Real, a Living, and Inward Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; 'Tis their Participation of the Divine Nature, 'tis Christ formed in them, and vitally delineated on their Souls, so that the <hi>same mind</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Phil: 2.5.</note>, the same Holy Dispositions, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, these same Divine Graces, that were eminently in Him, are by the

Now a sincere and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant obedience to the Precepts of the Gospel, is the great mean which the Divine Wisdom hath appointed, in order to introduce this Righteousness into the Souls of Men; And from the whole it is, I think, sufficiently evident, That our blessed LORD in delivering the Doctrines of our Religion to the World, intended that they should be obeyed, and that to fix on any other design, to the exclusion of this that I have been insisting on, is to render these Rules of Holy Living useless, and to represent them as vain, impertinent, and superfluous.</p>

And therefore our LORD had very good reason to recommend the Precepts of the Gospel to his Followers,<note n="a" place="margin">Mat: 11.29.</note> as an <hi>easie Yoke and a light burden,</hi> to which also his beloved Disciple St. <hi>John</hi> gives his Suffrage, telling us, from his own Experience no doubt, That<note n="b" place="margin">1 Jo: 5.3.</note>
                        <hi>His Commandments are not griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> 'Tis true our Flesh and Blood, our lusts, and corrupt inclinations, will be ready enough to fly in the face of these excellent Precepts, as severe and rigorous impositions. But we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that they were not intended to gratify our lusts and vicious appetites, but to root them out, to overcome and defeat them, by obliging us constantly and resolutely to check, &amp; by all means Resist them, and by all means to endeavour to get our selves rid of them, as being the distempers of our Souls, the hinderances of our Peace, and the certain obstructions of our Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; And thô the Receipts that are prescribed to us, in order to redress our fatal distempers, may be very harsh

To be short, since our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Redeemer hath made obedience to the Preeepts of the Gospel, to be as it were the very Essence of his Faithful Followers, the certain Evidence of true Love to him, and the only undeceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mark and Character, that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes them from the hypocritical and hollow hearted, telling them at every time, <hi>If ye</hi>

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:104909:272"/> early and cordial engaging in it, would prevent these many disadvantages and uneasinesses that must infallibly attend longer delays. Let them be very seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously cautioned against these soft and flattering doctrines, which either direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or by plain and necessarie conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, do evacuat and disanul this holy Obedience, as so many poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and destructive infusions. Alas! to many of this sort are abroad in the World, and by a sad fate, they have got the reputation to be considered as the principal and most valuable points of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> thô in effect they are the bane and plagues of it, have so ruin'd and disfigured it, that even the very knowledge of the nature and designs of it, is no more retain'd by too too many who still pretend to profess it, and to be very Zealous for the Interests of it. However, these ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie Truths, are very early dropt into the Hearts of Young Ones, and recommended to them as Articles of Faith, and they take such root in them, and so grow up with them, that to speak to them in their riper years, of a Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Law, that indispensably obliges
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:104909:272"/> them to Obedience, as the condition of their Salvation, would be to scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize and offend them, thô nothing can be plainer than that almost every page in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> do bear constant Testimonies unto this great Truth. O that it would please the Father of Lights, to dissipat these thick clouds of ignorance and woeful prejudices that darken the minds of Men, That He would retrive pure and primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie, rid the World of these sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing schems of divinity that are calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for the interests of the <hi>old man,</hi> and restore to His Church these Happy and long'd for Dayes, wherein such open, plain, and express Declarations as these, <hi>Blessed are</hi>

                     <p>But we must remember, That as Seed, thô it be very excellent in its kind, yet it cannot prosper, if it be cast into an improper Soil; If for instance it be dropt <hi>by the way side, fall amongst thorns, or stonie ground;</hi> So the Words of the Holy Jesus, that incorruptible Seed of Divine Graces, cannot fructifie, will not put forth their Force and Efficacie in the hearts of such as will still retain their lusts, &amp; indulge all the appetites of their <hi>old man.</hi> And accordingly our LORD informs us in His Explication<note n="e" place="margin">Mat: 13.22.</note> of the Parable of the Sower, That <hi>the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:104909:275"/> of riches choke the Word, and it becometh unfruitful.</hi> Certainly the Doctrine of the Gospel produces its wonderful Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and prospers only in simple and guileless Souls, that meekly yield to the Remonstrances of it, that heartily believe the good Things it promises, and the threatnings it denounces; And in a word, that receive it with full and peremptorie Resolutions of Obedience. It is in vain for us to expect that we shall feel the Divine Efficacies of it on any other terms, or imagine that it will spring up within us into Christian Graces, while we choke and stiffle it by the weeds and thorns of our indulged lusts and vicious inclinations. And in effect, as long as we only admitt it His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torically and notionally into our Heads, and not practically also into our Hearts; The fruits that will follow upon it, will be none other but a pharisaical pride and self conceit, and a disdainful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of others rash judgement and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable censuring, hypocrisie and presumption, a disputacious temper, and endless wrangling about triffles, a frothy chat and talking of Religious Matters, and a formal practising the Externals
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:104909:275"/> of Piety, without any thing of the Life and Power.</p>
                     <p>Now what hath been said on this Head, may be improven into very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Consequences, and which the Youth, not without their great Benefit, ought to be obliged to take notice of; As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From this a fair opportunity is afforded to induce them <hi>very highlie to value the Doctrine of Jesus Christ.</hi> The Efficacie of it in producing such noble and lovely Effects as we have instanced in, is a sufficient Document of its singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Excellencie, and consequently a just ground of puting a very great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem upon it; For the Power and Vertue of Things do extreamly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, and more especially when their Vertue is such as discovers it self in very notable and useful Operations. O the mighty Force and Power of the Words of Jesus! How marvellous do they operat on the Souls of Men! They are a <hi>Divine Panacea,</hi> a Remedie whose Medicinal Efficacie reaches unto all the distempers of the <hi>Inward Man:</hi> For by these dead Souls are raised up and quickned into a Divine Life, hard Hearts are softened into a Penitential
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:104909:276"/> Contrition, the troubled in Spirit eas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and solaced, the faint and timorous made bold and couragious, the weak and feeble corroborated, the ignorant instructed, the wandering reduced, the doubtful resolved, the defiled purified, the decayed Souls restored, the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nourished, the hungrie satisfied, and the wearie refreshed; Boisterous passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hush't and calm'd, and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat appetites checked and mortified; And in one word, the new Creature formed. It was the Experience which the Saints have had of a Power and Vertue in the Sacred Oracles that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated after so noble and excellent a manner as this, that made them pay such singular Deferences to the Word of GOD, and to express the Value they had for it in emphatical and rapturous Terms. The Royal Psalmist, after that he had taken a view of some of the precious Fruits which these Divine Words produce in the Souls of Men, tells us,<note n="*" place="margin">Psal: 19.10.</note>
                        <hi>That they are more to be desired than Gold, yea, than much fine Gold, sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er also than the Honey and the Honey-comb.</hi> And in his great Psalm, as on the one hand he doth from his own Experience,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:104909:276"/> furnish us with a great many instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Power and Energie of the Testimonies and Word of GOD; so for this Reason on the other; He doth with most devout Eloquence and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of very pathetick and warm Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, represent the incomparable Value He hath put upon them. All this so evidently appears from every Verse, that it is needless to quot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Passages to evince the Truth of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To the end that the Youth may speedily attain to the Experience and Sense of the mighty Efficacie of the Christian Doctrine in their own Hearts, let it be seriously recommended to them, <hi>To beware of whatever may choke it,</hi> and hinder it from displaying its Force and Vertue. We learn from the Parable of the Sower, That there are several grounds in which the Seed of Divine Truths doth not prosper, to be sure the fault is in the soil, and not in the Seed, for it is one and the same good Seed that is sowen in all; So when the <hi>Word of the Kingdom</hi> doth not fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in the Hearts of Men, 'tis certain that this must be imputed to the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:104909:277"/> of their dispositions, and to their allowing the weeds of lusts, and carnal and earthly affections to spring up and grow within them. And therefore let the Youth be directed to check the first buddings of corruption, and to pluck up as it were by the roots, these choking weeds, as soon as they begin to appear. Let them be exhorted in the words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet: 2.1, 2.</note>
                        <hi>To lay aside all malice and all guile, and hypocrisies, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, and all evil speakings, and as new born Babes to drink in the sincere Milk of the Word, that they may grow thereby.</hi> And from this Passage let occasion be taken to tell them, that as long as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge and gratifie their lusts and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by so doing nourish and strengthen their <hi>old man,</hi> it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that the <hi>Milk of the Word,</hi> That is, the Doctrine of the Gospel, which is the Aliment and Food of our Spiritual Life, can nourish and give Vigor to our Souls▪ or advance them in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Profession; For as poison, when one takes it often, will hinder the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somest and most agreeable Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from doing any good to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, so carnal and earthly affections,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:104909:277"/> inordinat and vicious appetites and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which indeed are poisonous and destructive to our better part; Will, when entertained in the Heart, hinder that the Divinest and most Saving Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine shall not Benefit the Soul.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Since the Doctrine of Jesus Christ is Efficacious in the Hearts of all who due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive it; Let the Youth be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently directed to <hi>Enquire</hi> whither it hath exerted its Force and Power in them, and in order to determine of this aright, let them be taught to take their Measures from the <hi>Appearances of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and native Fruits of it</hi> in their own Hearts and Lives. It is doubtless from these that we can have the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and infallible Marks of its Success and Fertility; For as when we have sowen Wheat or some such other Grain, and when we see that it hath sprung up and ripened into a plentiful Cropt, and is of the same Nature and Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with the Grain that was sowen, we justly conclude that it hath put forth its Seminal Vertue, and prospered; But on the other Hand, when, after we have cast good Grain into our Field, we discover nothing of that same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:104909:278"/> with what was sowen to grow up, nothing but Thistles and thorns, and the like noxious and useless weeds, we do on good Grounds resolve, that the Seed was cast into a soil that was not capable to nourish it, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it was not in circumstances to exert its fertilizing Efficacie. Just so, when the Doctrine of the Gospel, which, as we have before remarked, our Saviour compares to Seed, hath by some means or other been scattered or sowen in our Hearts, and when we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that it hath sprung up within us, into all sorts of Christian Graces and Vertues, such as Penitencie, Humility, Self-denyal, Contempt of the World, Purity, Heavenly mindedness, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Meekness and Temperance, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Benignitie and Peaceableness, and such like, we may very confidently assure our selves, that it hath been Efficacious and Successful in us; For these are the Blessed Fruits which the Christian Doctrine was designed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and for this purpose it is, as hath been already often asserted and verified; It is, I say, impregnated with a Divine and Mighty Force, and thereby it becomes in all sincere Hearts, the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:104909:278"/> Principle of all Holy and Gracious, both Dispositions and Practices, so that where-ever the Fruits of the Spirit, and the Works of Righteousness are truely found, there the Efficacie of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Son of GOD must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed as the Principle and Cause. But when this Heavenly Doctrine is dispensed, and nothing follows upon it, among those to whom it is preached, but a formal piety, &amp; a barren professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nothing but the works of the flesh, nothing but base born lusts &amp; passions, covetousness and earthly mindedness, hatred &amp; malice, envie and bitter zeal, strife and animosity, jars and divisions, we may securely determine, that how specious soever the pretences of such to Religion may be, yet in effect, the Gospel hath never appeared in them in its Power.</p>
                     <p n="3">III.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>III.</hi> An useful Method recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for instructing the Youth in the Particulars of the Christian Religion.</note> The Nature of the Christian Doctrine being thus represented to the <hi>Youth,</hi> and by the display of its Lovely Qualities, having effectually recommended it to their Esteem and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so the Foundation of their
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:104909:279"/> puting it in practice being happily laid, it follows next, that great care be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to <hi>acquaint</hi> them with the <hi>Particulars</hi> of it. Hitherto they have bad occasion to behold it only in the Gross, to see some of its admirable Properties, to notice its excellent Tendencies and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs; But it is moreover indispensably necessary, that the several parts of it be exposed to their View, that so through the Blessing of GOD on the Pious Endeavours of Instructors, they may come by degrees to be fully and particularly informed in the Great Truths and Duties of it; And that this part of the Task may be done success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, I would recommend the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Advices to their Overseers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In order to acquaint the Youth with the Doctrines of the Son of GOD in particular, we must be careful that we do not fetch it from the discourses and writings of Men, who are not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly Fallible, but also too too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly partial and byassed, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by their passions and prejudices. To be sure, their Systems and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, their Confessions of Faith, and Catechisms, are generally too
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:104909:279"/> muddy Sources to give us any solid Grounds of hoping that the Truths of our Religion, could issue from them Pure and Undisguised. These sorts of Composures are infinitly variable, and put on different Faces, according to the different Humours, Opinions, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of the several Parties; But the Doctrine of Jesus Christ is ever the same, and changes not. In works of this Nature, some things are obtruded on the World, as the Doctrines of the Son of GOD, that indeed are none of His, and some things that are His, are so disfigured and misrepresented, that they cannot be owned as such: Things of the vastest Importance, are either quit omitted, or carelesly touched on, and things of very small or no moment in Religion vehemently urged, as if they were the great Essentials of it. However, so high a Value is put on Confessions and Catechisms, by the Votaries of the different Parties, that to contradict or reject any Article or Proposition in them, is construed to be as Piacular, and is as warmly resented, as if the Truths of the Bible were thus treated; And I have been often surpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:104909:280"/> to hear Passages quoted out of them for the Establishment of Truth, and refutation of Error, with no less Assurance, than if they were the Sacred and Infallible Oracles of GOD. This is one of the unhappy consequences of a mismanaged Education: People are taught from their Infancy to pay a vast deall of Deference to this sort of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, they are made to look on them as the Standard and Measure of Truth and Error, and thô ones thoughts be never so agreeable to the Holy Scriptures, yet if they clash with these confessional Decisions, he must resolve presently to commence <hi>Heretick</hi> and to be loaded with all the ill names in the World. In the mean time, it is not denyed but <hi>Confessions of Faith,</hi> and specially <hi>Catechisms,</hi> are of excellent use for the Instruction of Youth, they are so certainly, when they are the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posures of Wise and Good Men, of Men that are Sober and Moderat, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial and Peaceable, and who regard the Concerns of Christianity in general, more than the petty Interests and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Sects in particular. When they are such as urge and explain the
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:104909:280"/> great and necessarie Truths of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and do not enervat and darken them by guileful and flattering com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when they do not obtrude on the beliefs of Christians, airie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain speculations as articles of Faith, and when less weighty matters are not set on the same level, nor made to be of the same necessity with the Essential and indispensable Truths and Duties of the Gospel. However, I say it is not from these, and especially as they are now a dayes ordered, that we must derive the Christian Doctrines for the Information of Youth: No sure, we must for this end go to a Diviner Source, even to the Holy Scriptures, which the blessed GOD hath consign'd to His Church, as the Authentick Records of His Will, and are by the unanimous Consent of all Christians acknowledged as such. But,</p>

'Tis in these that the great and fundamental Articles of Faith, the necessarie and indispensable Rules of Duty are laid down, that by very En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing Motives He invites Men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come His Disciples, and encourages His Followers to a persevering Fidelity, and that He declares what will be the sad fare of the incorrigible and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. In short, we must not imagine that this great and incomparable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the Head and Chief of all the Prophets, He who was so singular a Person, and so singularly accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, He who was Invested with so extraordinarie an Authority, and so eminently acquainted with the Counsels
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:104909:282"/> and Designs of GOD, did deliver His Will imperfectly to the World, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any thing that was necessarie for Men, either to believe or do, in order to be Eternally Happy: No sure, for, during the course of His Ministerie on Earth, He gave a full and perfect System of the <hi>Christian Religion; That is,</hi> Of whatever was absolutely and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably necessarie to constitute a true Christian: So that whatever Truths or Duties the Holy Apostles, or any other truely Illuminated Persons have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards communicated to the World, must not be look'd on as Additions to the Essence of Christianity, but are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Enlargements on &amp; a Prosecution of the same Things that were delivered by the Son of GOD Himself, Deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from them, and a suting and applying them to the different States and Circumstances that Mankind may be in, or Discoveries and Explications of some Misteries and Divine Secrets, which thô they may be very singularly Useful, yet are not necessarie to our being Christians; From all it is plain, That in order to inform the Youth of the Doctrines of the Son of GOD in particular, a peculiar Regard must be
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:104909:283"/> had to His own Heavenly Discourses: It is from what the Blessed Author of our Religion hath Himself delivered and taught, that we are all in Reason to learn the Truths and Duties of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Having thus condescended on the Source whence the Christian Doctrines must be drawn for the Instruction of Youth, I would in the next place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to such as are obliged to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versee them, that they take care to <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with the Parables of our Blessed Saviour.</hi> These are full of Heavenly Instructions, and by a Sacred Artifice, do convey the most important Things, with Ease and Pleasure into the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Capacities. They are very accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modat to engage the attention of Young Ones, because they are put in an His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical Dress; For Discourses of this Nature, Youth is wont to be much delighted with, and do easily retain: 'Tis true the Truths and Duties of our Religion are there under a Vail, but such as may be easily penetrated. Our LORD Himself hath explained a great many of them, some are obvious and plain enough in themselves; And as to
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:104909:283"/> these that are more dark, a careful Attention unto the Circumstances in which they were delivered, will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine a serious, well disposed and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Reader, to put a solid and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Meaning upon them. Let these <hi>Divine Parables,</hi> in the same Order in which they are Recorded in the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,</hi> one after another, and yet but one at once, be at some set times fixed on, and by way of <hi>Question</hi> and <hi>Answer,</hi> be made familiar unto the Youth, if this, or some such other Method, that the Discretion and Piety of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structors will suggest on this Head, be taken, and insisted on as long as it will be thought needful, and if the whole be managed in so serious and winning a Manner, as will bespeak and engage their Affections; I am very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that in a short time a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny very excellent, important and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Particulars of the Christian Doctrine will be happily dropt into their Hearts.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Since the Gospel of St. <hi>John</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains more of the Doctrinal Discourses of out Blessed Saviour, than any other of the Gospels; Since his pen runs in so rapturous and seraphick a Strain, and
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:104909:284"/> yet simple and undisguised, since the Matters that he hath recorded are Great and Noble, Sublime and Elevated, and yet necessarie, solid and instructive; Since they are the sweet Things, and as it were, the Flowers and Honey Comb of our Religion that he treats of; Such as, the Divinity of our Blessed Redeemer, the Dignity of His Person, the Excellency of His Merits, the Riches and Power of His Grace, the exceeding Greatness of His Love, the Noble Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges entail'd on all His Faithful Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, the precious Promises that are made to them, the Consolations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them, the Badge and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter by which they are known, <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the great Commandment of Love,</hi> their most essential and indispensable Obligation, <hi>Conformitie to, and Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their LORD and Master:</hi> And in fine, The Glory to which they shall be advanced in the other World; It will not, I am sure, seem strange, if I moreover enj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>yn, in order to acquaint the Youth with the Particulars of the Christian Doctrine, that they be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a <hi>frequent and serious perusal of this Book,</hi> that they converse with it, until
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:104909:284"/> every Period of it be not only fixed in their Memories, but also imprinted on their Hearts, that they read it, and meditat on it, until it be digested as it were, into their Marrow and Substance, till it spring up within them, into Life and Practice, Love and Obedience. It is certain that the Ancients expressed a peculiar Esteem and Veneration for this Gospel, I shall adduce only in Confirmation of this, that known Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> in his Harmony of the <hi>Evangelists.</hi>
                        <q>St. <hi>John</hi> (saith he) was particularly pitched on to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Divinity of Jesus Christ; And whereas the other three do in some sort walk on Earth with Jesus Christ as Man, and record the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of His Mortal Life, St. <hi>John</hi> on the contrarie mounts up as an Eagle above the clouds of humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and advances To farr as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> GOD equal to GOD, <hi>in the Bosome of the Father,</hi> without that his Eyes were dazled with the Lustre of that Glory. He insists more than the other, in declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Instructions of the Son of GOD, and principally these that
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:104909:285"/> are the most Sublime; And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other <hi>Evangelists</hi> represent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly these Actions of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in which he gives us a Model for regulating our manners, and for the Conduct of our Lives. <hi>John</hi> on the other Hand, having resolved to supply what the other had omitted, applyed himself more especially to deliver the more Spiritual Truths. And it is very remarkable, (adds the same Father) That this <hi>Evangelist</hi> who speaks more Sublimely than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three, is he who also recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends unto us more frequently and more vigorously the Love of our Brethren.

                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Our Blessed Saviour's Divine and incomparable Sermon on the Mount, recorded in the 5, 6, and 7.
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:104909:285"/> Chapters of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> is an Abrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Christian Doctrine; It contains the great and essential Precepts of the Gospel. It informs us of these Conditions, the performance whereof is required of us, in order to obtain Salvation by Jesus Christ. To be short, in this admirable Sermon the Gospel Law is published to all the World: And therefore it is absolutely necessarie, that the Youth be instructed in all the Particulars of it: And it is sad to observe, that in Educating them in the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> so little regard is had to these <hi>Great Things,</hi> which the Authority of our Redeemer hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Sacred, Necessarie, and Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable. Things of very small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the peculiar Principles and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of this, and that and the other Partie are with Zeal and Diligence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcat on them, according as it is their Lot to fall under the Conduct of the Respective Votaries, whereas the indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable Maxims of <hi>Christianitie</hi> are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little noticed, or at least, not urged with the like Favour. I am of the mind, that if what our LORD hath delivered in the mentioned Chapters
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:104909:286"/> of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> were digested into a plain and easie Catechism, and put in the hands of the Youth, it would without doubt much more effectually serve the Interests of their Souls, than these that they are commonly obliged to make use of, in some of which are scarcely so much as one of the great Precepts recommended in this Sermon, can be discovered from the beginning to the end, and what Truths are in them are so hideously embarassed, darkened, and disfigured by the Speculations and Dialect of the Schools, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted into them, that I am fully perswaded, that in stead of contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the advancement of the Youth, in the true and solid Knowledge of GOD and JESUS CHRIST, and of their Duty as Christians, they are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very great hinderances to it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But after all, It will, I doubt not, be judged very expedient, and even necessarie, that the most noted and most essential Points of the <hi>Christian Doctrine</hi> be more specially inculcated on the Youth, that they may have them still in their View, and regard them as Sacred and Inviolable Maxims or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorisms,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:104909:286"/> whereby to regular their Hearts and Lives. The great and foundamental Heads of Christianitie are not very numerous, they may be reduced to a narrower compass than is commonly imagined; And these to the best of my thoughts, are pitched on in the following Instances, which are of such Importance and Moment, that too much pains cannot be taken to urge them on these in whose favours we are tending our best Advances.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And the first I shall mention is that wherewith our LORD began the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of His Ministrie a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mong the Sons of Men,<note place="margin">A view of the most noted and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Heads of Christian Doctrine, that ought to be inculcated on the Youth.</note> I mean the <hi>Doctrine of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> which is our Entrance on the Christian Life, <hi>Repent</hi> (saith he)<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 4.17.</note>
                        <hi>for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> Now this Repentance consists not meerly in a sorrowing or grieving for sin, but in a peremptorie and present disclaiming and foresaking it, and in actual and unfeigned turning of the Heart towards GOD, with full and sincere Purposes of undergoing and practising whatever may contribute
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:104909:287"/> to kil and destroy the root of sin in us. This is the very same with what out our Saviour else where<note n="*" place="margin">Mat: 18.3.</note> calls <hi>Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> And when the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent converted Soul hath through the mightie Operations of the Spirit <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the deeds of the bodie,</hi> corrupted the <hi>old man,</hi> and attained to a State of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Purity, then he enters on that which is properly and distinctly the State of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> wherein one is truely born of GOD, partakes of His Nature, and bears His Image, is Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, Illuminated and Solaced, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced, Acted and Directed by Him. This is the very top of Christian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the highest pitches of it that are attainable in this Life, and to which alas they are infinitly rare, who do truely aspire, and fewer yet who do effectually arrive at them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A second essential Head of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine I give, is that of <hi>Believing in Jesus Christ. GOD gave<note n="*" place="margin">Jo: 3.16.</note> his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting Life.</hi> We find that a great dale of stress is
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:104909:287"/> laid on this point, our LORD doth very often insist on it, and represents it as comprehending the whole Duty of a Christian. But then we must take care that we do not form to our selves false or maimed notions of it. Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Jesus Christ, consists in the <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onat, vigorous and lively Actings of our Souls towards Him, and that suteablie to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Views which the Gospel obliges us to have of Him; Or, in a just Correspondence to these different Relations which He bears to us as our Bedeemer,</hi> and hence more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, out believing in Him, is our <hi>Owning and accepting of Him as our Master and Leader,</hi> and so our becoming prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically His <hi>Disciples</hi> and <hi>Followers:</hi> It is a trustful and entire <hi>Surrender</hi> of our Souls to His Conduct and Instruction, as He is the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> and the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Teacher</hi> of the <hi>Inner Man;</hi> It is an <hi>Eyeing</hi> of <hi>Him</hi> as our <hi>Pattern;</hi> And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence hereof, a readie and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal <hi>Imitation</hi> of Him as such, and <hi>Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as He Walked:</hi> It is an <hi>Addressing</hi> Him as a <hi>Physician</hi> and <hi>Healer,</hi> and therefore it includes our <hi>beartie consenting,</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the <hi>Methods,</hi> which He prescribes for the Cure and Restoration of our lapsed
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:104909:288"/> Natures. An <hi>Acknowledging</hi> Him as our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Soveraign,</hi> which necessarly obliges to an <hi>unfeigned Subjection</hi> to His Laws, evidencing it self by a faithful and persevering Obedience, and then to an unsollicitous Dependance on Him for His Protection and Divine Force, in order to combat successfully against our ghostlie enemies, and to get the victorie over them. It is <hi>a viewing</hi> of Him as our <hi>High Priest,</hi> offering up Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for our sakes, in the flames of an immense and most disinteressed love, a sacrifice both infinitly meritorious and exemplarie; And thereupon, a <hi>Recurring</hi> unto GOD through Him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the deep and penitential sense of the guilt and filth and power of sin, for Pardon and Mercie, and for Grace to conform to our suffering Jesus, by the sacrificing of our selves to Him in the practice of a daily self denyal, and mortification of our <hi>old man,</hi> and in Acts of the most fervent Love and gracefulest Acknowledgements that we can be capable of It is in fine <hi>a looking</hi> to Him as our <hi>Victorious</hi> and <hi>Triumphant Conquerour,</hi> now exalted in Glory, and holding in His Hand the noble <hi>Prize,</hi>
                        <pb n="469" facs="tcp:104909:288"/> &amp; assuring us, that if we trace His Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps, He will infallibly confer it on us. Whence ought indispensably to follow, our resolute engaging in the Spiritual Warfare, and our living on the yet invisible Glories He hath procured for us, and promised to us, in a generous contempt of the deceitful promises wherewith the world, the devil, or our flesh would flatter us, joyfully hoping that upon our persevering fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, till we have <hi>run out our Race, and fought the Good Fight,</hi> we shall be admitted into the full and endless Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of them. Certainly this is the Import of <hi>Believing in Jesus Christ,</hi> and this is that <hi>Faith</hi> on which Eternal Life is entail'd, for this that is here prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is that Faith which <hi>purifies the Heart,</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 15.9.</note> which <hi>worketh</hi>

                        <hi>overcometh the world.</hi> It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a very comprehensive Dutie, all others are virtually included in it, and spring up from it, as from their Root and Source. But to imagine that all its Vertue or Usefulness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in that one particular, and single Acts of <hi>Relying</hi> on the Merits of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, to the exclusion of all others,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:104909:289"/> which however are as essential to it, and by Divine Establishment as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, in order to obtain Pardon and Grace and Salvation, and so sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>illy to prescind and separat it from its self, is sadly to misrepresent it, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our selves; For this is to give Men ground to fancy that they have the whole, when they have at best but a part, and such a part too, as when it is separat from the rest, is but a vain and hypocritical presumption, and can never entitle any to the Favour of GOD, and the Glories of Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Christian Beatitudes</hi> set down at the entrance of our LORD's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course on the Mount, are the third mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentuous and weighty Head of the Gospel Doctrine that I instance in, and which I would have recommended to the Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uth, as so many precious &amp; inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Jewels. O how great and noble things are <hi>povertie of Spirit, Penitential Mourning. Meekness, an hungring and thirsting after Righteousness, Mercifulness, Puritie of Heart, Peaceableness, and a patient bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of persecution for Righteousness sake!</hi> These are the sure and undeceiving Characters of a true Disclple of Jesus;
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:104909:289"/> These are both the Ornaments that beautifie and recommend, and the prime Ingredients that constitute and form a sincere Christian. 'Tis from these that we must take our Measures, whereby to know the Truth of our Christianity, and to determine justly of the Goodness and badness of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, with regard to GOD and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; For it is certain that proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, as these Graces are more or less, or not at all discoverable in us, so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we may safely conclude, that we are more or less, or not at all Christians. These Marks of our Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in Religion, and of our Interests in the Promises of the Gospel, which the blind and flattering self love of Men have set up, are lubricous and illusive, they do but sow pillows under our Arms, and make us groundlesly presume that we are assured of Heaven, thô we want these Dispositions that must qualifie and prepare us for it. But the Marks which Truth it self hath established are certain and infallible, and cannot deceive us, and they are these that we must search for in our Hearts, in order to be assured of our
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:104909:290"/> Title to the peculiar Favours of GOD and the Glories of the other World; we may learn what stress they bear in the Christian Religion, and what Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue our Lord puts on them, from these precious and endearing Promises which He hath annexed to each of them in particular. To be sure, they must not be mean and contemptible things, things of small moment and concern, that the Holy Jesus so solemnly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, and puts in a dress, that at once evinces, both how necessarie and how excellent they are; And yet it is surprizing to see that they are so little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed in these Formularies that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for the Instruction of Youth. I need not tell any serious and thinking persons, that these great Things of our Religion, are more proper to season Young Hearts, and more calculated to beget in them a Christian Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Disposition, than the urging on them, and explaining to them the peculiar Speculations and Sentiments, the passions and prejudices of a partie, which very often are of that make and genius, that in stead of introducing and cherishing-in them a Temper and
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:104909:290"/> Frame becoming the Gospel, do really stiffle and choke it, by their being nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished up in a blind and pertinacions zeal for some things, in favours where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thay are taught to sacrifice and trample on such as are more weightie and more indispensable.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourth Point I mention is, that great and fundamental Lesson of our Religion, the Learning and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing whereof is so essential to our being Christians, that it is in vain for us to pretend to be of that Number, while we are strangers to it. What I am at is set down in that notted Passage of the Gospel,<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 9.23.</note>
                        <hi>If any Man will come after Me, let him deny bimself, and take up his cross daily and follow me.</hi> These are the memorable Words of the Blessed Jesus, wherein He declares what the Terms are, which all that would become His Followers, and inherit the Glorious Priviledges that He hath merited for them, must resolve to accept of and comform unto. They are so punctually recorded by the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and so often inculcated, sometimes in the very same Expression, and at other times, in equivalent Terms, that doubtless
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:104909:291"/> they considered them, as containing one of the most essential Maxims of the Gospel, and indeed it is not possible to give a more Just, a more Genuine, and a more perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of a Christian, than that which is exhibited to us in this Passage, <hi>If any Man will come after Me,</hi> That is, whoever will own Me as his Master and Teacher, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my Disciple, I shall acquaint him before hand with what he must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably resolve to do: The first and great Lesson I set before him, and which he must effectually learn and practise, is this, <hi>Let him deny himself,</hi> That is, he must renounce and despise, foresake, and hate all that is vicious and depraved in him, thô never so dear and valuable in his Eyes, all the lusts and passions, the appetites and inclinations of his <hi>old man,</hi> all his own wisdom and strength, and all the false appearances of Religion, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Vertue, that are meerly the products of his own lapsed faculties and activitie, without the Intervention of the Operations of Divine Grace. In a word, all that naturally issue from his own Heart, as it is originally

<pb n="479" facs="tcp:104909:293"/> made use of, in order to engage young hearts to pursue and aspire with all the ardencie imaginable after the love of GOD, and of all his Creatures in him, and for his sake. Now under this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Dispensation, the great Precept of <hi>Love to GOD and Man, is Reinforced,</hi> with a great many new Endearments and Motives; Such as, the suprizing Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations of the Love and good will of GOD in the Redemption of the World. The Condescendencie &amp; Sufferings, the Melting Charitie &amp; Compassions of the Son of GOD, the Graces, Assistences, and Consolations of the Holy Spirit, the publications of Pardon and Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and the evident promises of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life; All which, when seriously considered, ought inviolably to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us, both to make all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of Love to GOD that are possible for us, and to imitat in our Carriages towards Man, the Methods of merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lness ond Condescendencie of Benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Good will, that are exemplified to us in the Gospel Dispensation. And as Love is now Reinforced by new, and more winning obligations, so moreover the views of it are more enlarged, both
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:104909:294"/> with regard to GOD and Man; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the more GOD is known the more He is or ought to be Loved; For everie new discoverie of his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is as it were an exhibition of a new beauty, and carries alongs with it a new Endearment. Now it is evident, that under the Gospel, God hath more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie manifested himself, than under fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Oeconomies,</hi> and consequently hath afforded a more Ample Field for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of our Love, which indispensably binds us to more enlarged effusions of it. And when we understand that <hi>GOD was in Christ, reconciling the World to himself,</hi> that he hath commanded the offers of His Grace and Pardon to be published to <hi>every Creature,</hi> and that he hath so Solemny protested, that <hi>he is not willing, that any of the Children of Men should perish, but that all should come to the knowledge of the Truth, repent and be saved;</hi> how can we find it in our hearts, to shut out any from the enfluences of our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or confine the Bowels of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to a few? When we learn that our Dear Redeemer forgave his very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and hath commanded us to Love ours, how dare we pretend to be His
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:104909:294"/> Disciples, when we neither imitate His Example, nor obey His Precept in this Great and Capital particular? But yet further, now under the Gospel, the <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of having the Divine Grace of Love im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in our Souls,</hi> and of Vigorously Exercising it both towards GOD and Man is more fully asserted: Our Lord, we see, recommends it as the summ and substance of the <hi>Law and the Prophets,</hi> and in effect all other duties are but different appearances of Love, And without that it Animate and Breath in them, they are but poor and lean performances, empty and useless shews of Religion. And as <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> so it filleth almost every page of the Gospel, and all the Writings of the Apostles; As One well observes, That when they speak of <hi>Faith,</hi> it is of none other <hi>Faith</hi> then that <hi>which worketh by Love.</hi> The Holy <hi>Jesus</hi> hath established it as the Motto and Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, the Badge and Character of his Disciples; <hi>A New Commandment,</hi> saith he, <hi>I give unto you, that you love one another, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But certainly our love to them before it can be deem'd sincere and genuine, must issue from a Nobler source, even from the <hi>love of GOD,</hi> For if it does not spring from this divine Root, it is, but an Animal and Mercenarie Affection, and incapable to exert in their favours these generous and disinterested, these lasting and parma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent acts, which <hi>charity that never falls, and that seeketh not her</hi> own, is so valuable and so remarkable, for.</p>
                     <p>Here it is verie seriouslie to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that as true love to Man is in its
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:104909:299"/> Original an Efflux from our love to <hi>God,</hi> so in its exercise it is a practicai imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that love which God bears to his Creatures. Now that which God loves in his Creatures is himself, that is, the Image &amp; Resemblance of his own Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Perfections. He loves them as they bear the impressions and characters of His Power, Wisdom and Goodness, his Life, Beautie and Felicitie. And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity hereunto, that which holy souls love in the Creatures is God appearing to them in the Beautifull Reflexes of his own infinit Excellencies. As he loves these most who do most perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him, so also do they. And as, tho <hi>his tender</hi>

                        <hi>Secrets,</hi> his peculiar Communications, <hi>are with the Righteous, and with them that fear him.</hi> Accordingly their love keeps the same measures; for tho' they are readie<note n="(b)" place="margin">Gal. 6.10.</note>
                        <hi>to do good unto all men,</hi> yet they have pecullar tendernesses for <hi>those of the Houshold of Faith.</hi> As he, when his Creatures turn away from him, and sin, doth out of his great love to them use all possible endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them, so likewise their love pushes thee to do the same. And indeed one of
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:104909:299"/> the highest and most Genuine expressions of charity to our Neighbours is, to do all that is possible for us to recover him from his fall, and to bring him back to the Love of GOD; And as his Love inclines him to be <hi>Merciful &amp; Patient, and slow to anger, condescending and readie to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give;</hi> so theirs also is of the same <hi>Genius,</hi> and disposes them to Transcribe the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie that his Love sets before them. They put on<note n="(e)" place="margin">Col: 3.3.14.</note>
                        <hi>Bowels of Mercies, Kindness, Humbleness of mind, Meekness and Long suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they forbear and forgive one another.</hi> And thus as to all other instances of Love,<note n="(d)" place="margin">Eph: 5:1:</note>
                        <hi>they are followers of God as dear Children,</hi> For that pure flame which their Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father hath kindled in their hearts, first mounts up to himself, and then in him and for his sake, sallies out to the Creatures, in a Just conformitie to that love which himself exerciseth towards them.</p>
                     <p>In fine, as under the Christian dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, the precept of <hi>love</hi> is Reinforced by new motives, as the views of it are more enlarged, &amp; the necessity of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it more fully asserted, so moreover <hi>the methods of attaining it, are more plainly discovered.</hi> We are here to rememher that
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:104909:300"/> love to man is, as hath been alreadie remarked, an Emanation from the love of GOD, and consequently, when once the love of GOD is introduced into the Soul, charity to man necessarly issues from it, and grows up with it. Now the methods which the Gospel prescribes, in order to attain to the Love of GOD, or for introducing it unto the Soul, are the <hi>cleansing our hearts from all impure and Forreign loves, the riding them of self and Creatures, the crucifying in them all these lusts</hi> and turning them from these objects and occasions that divert them from and incapacitat them for the entertaining so noble a passion, or in short, the sincere and daily practise of that self denyall, that was recommended under the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Head. The Love of GOD is a pure and Heavenly flame, and cannot mingle with Corruption and filthiness, and therefore if we would have it seise on us, and to burn brightly within our breasts, we must diligently labour to purge our hearts from all Defilements, and as we advance in purity, so propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally will the Love of GOD grow up &amp; prosper in our Souls. Further the love of GOD is the end of our Creation, it
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:104909:300"/> was for the intertaining of it, that our Souls were made, and therefore it is Just, that they should be wholie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reservedly consecrated to it; Divine love is Jealous, and will not admit of Rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or competition. And hence it is that onr Lord tells us;<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Matt. 6.24.</note>
                        <hi>we cannot serve God and Mammon;</hi> And his beloved Disciple enjoyns <hi>not to love the World,</hi>

<pb n="495" facs="tcp:104909:301"/> therefore. I suppose, it will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, nor yet altogether a digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from my main design, if I here briefly state the <hi>trve notion of this Divinity;</hi> For it is not sit, that the <hi>Youth</hi> be trained up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der prejudices, against that which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise might excellently contribute to advance them in a solid and serious pietie and Devotion. And I chose to take my account of it from another, and one who verie well understood it.</p>
                     <p>We shall not need, saith he<note n="(a)" place="margin">Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie du caeur au preface.</note> to be surprized, that the Mystick Divinity, being, as indeed it is, the scourge of vain occupations and unprofitable distractions and an infallible Counterpoyson against the <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Sounian</hi> Heresies, and all kinds of Dangerous errors, should so verie much displease both the vainly Learned, and the Disciples of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Socinus.</hi> But that persons otherwise, both Orthodox and Pious, should suffer themselvis to be prejudicat against it, is assuredly what they would be extreamly astonished at, were it not that their By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asses, are the effect of ignorance and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; For they have formed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, a false and Chimerial <hi>Idea</hi> of this Divine Theologie, and they do not
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:104909:302"/> consider, that it is nothing else but the <hi>purest knowledge,</hi> and the <hi>purest love of God,</hi> or the <hi>Ʋnion of the Soul with God,</hi> so far as it is attainable in this Life. And even to conceive justly of it it is the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Essence of the Christian Religion, and no Soul shall ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There are who fancie that the <hi>Mystick Divinity</hi> is nothing else but the <hi>Typical</hi> or <hi>Allegorieal</hi> explications of holy Scripture, and it is upon this score that they make it the object of their disdain. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be said in favours of the Divine way of interpreting the Scriptures <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically,</hi> it is not however in this that the <hi>Mystick Divinity</hi> consists. This that we now consider, is the symbolical or figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Theologie, and it is a huge mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to think that it is the Mystick. It is indeed true that Allegorical interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations do some times bear the name of Mystick, to wit, when the subject matter of them is of that Nature, but verie improperly when it is not so.</p>
                     <p>Others imagine that the <hi>Mystick Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> consists in I know not what ridculous efforts to put one's self in an extasie, or
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:104909:302"/> not to exert any acts of the mind, and to think on nothing. Or in a multitude of odd visions, wild speculations, and Extravagant terms and expressions which signifie nothing, and I cannot tell how many chimeras of this nature, all which are as far removed from the <hi>Mystick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> as Heaven is from Earth.</p>
                     <p>But the true Mystick Divinity being quite another thing, to the end we may have a Just Idea of it, it will be convenient to remark, that it may be taken in two different significations. The first is when we give it a more <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>narrow</hi> sense and then, it is only the union of the Soul with GOD, without considering the ways that have served as means to arrive at it. The other sense is more <hi>large</hi> and <hi>comprehensive</hi> and includes also the internal ways, by which the Soul can attain to this <hi>Divine Ʋnion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as there are two principal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the Soul, namely the <hi>Ʋnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> and the <hi>Will,</hi> and as one may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Divine Union by the one &amp; the other of these ways, so the Mystick Divinite, taken in its more comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive signification, is divided into two different kinds, whereof each hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:104909:303"/> to one of these ways.</p>
                     <p>The first is <hi>Extraodinarie;</hi> It is that of the way of the <hi>Ʋnderstanding</hi> which consists in this that God making its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivite to cease, operats in it by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural ways of Raptures and Extasie and by intellectual visions, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less ought not to be either dispised or rejected, when they come truly from God, seing we have so many examples of them in holy Scripture. But then all the Mystick Divines are agreed that this sort of Mystick Divinity is infinitly rare, and that one ought never to desire it, and if one hath a great propension towards it; he is thereby exposed to a thousand dangers, and to a thousand Diabolick illusions.</p>
                     <p>The other sort of <hi>Mystick, Divinity</hi> that I mean which regards <hi>the way of the will,</hi> consists in <hi>emptying</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> of the esteem and love of created things and of self, to the end it may be intirely devoted unto God, and may love nothing but Him alone, and the fulfilling of his Divine will, in Consequence whereof God uniting himself to the Soul, fills it with his Divinest love, communicats to it his purest lights. And this is the
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:104909:303"/> Mystical Divinitie, proportioned to the Capacity, and to the use of all Men. And would to GOD, that all would make it their business to study it well.</p>
                     <p>It is called <hi>Mystick,</hi> that is to say, <hi>hidden and secret,</hi> not only because the Divine Union is made inwardly in the secret <hi>Recesses of purified Hearts;</hi> But also, because the Wordly Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed understand nothing of these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Internal Communications of the Wisdom and of the Spirit of GOD. This is what <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> do inform us of, when they speak concerning the Sacred Theologie. <hi>He that loveth Me,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">John 14, 21, 23.</note> saith the Son of <hi>GOD, shall be loved of My Father, and I wlil love him; and will manifest my self unto him. If any one love Me, he will keep My words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make Our abode with him. Blessed</hi>

<pb n="500" facs="tcp:104909:304"/> wisdom, which none of the Sages of the world knew, and which one cannot know, but by the Spirit of GOD, which the Animal Man cannot receive, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, for it is foolishness unti him,</hi> and a matter of Jeer and Scorn:</p>
                     <p>It is moreover termed <hi>Mystick</hi> or <hi>hidden,</hi> because it can not be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to any person in a way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, and that we cannot prove, or make others Comprehend the reality and the Truths of it by any Ideas. It is the very same here, as in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Experience: One cannot, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, prove by reasoning to a person who never saw the Sun, that it is a brightly shinning Luminarie, nor give him an Idea of what its light is: We cannot by any Demonstration make one, who had never tasted any sweet thing, understand what sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is; Just so we cannot make any Body comprehend the lights of this Divine Science, and its force, but only by remitting such as would learn it to <hi>Experience,</hi> and to the
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:104909:304"/>
                        <hi>Faithful practice</hi> of these means which are proposed in it, in order to attain to the possession of it, which indeed is inseparable from the living Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what it is, who as before we come to this possession of it, we can have no true <hi>Idea</hi> of what its Terms signifie, which is also the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the ignorant do say, that it is but a heap of words, which <hi>signifie</hi> nothing, even as the terms of light, and colours are words which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing to such as are blind.</p>
                     <p>From this brief account of the <hi>Mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Divinity,</hi> I hope, it appears that it is not a <hi>Scheme</hi> of <hi>Airie</hi> and Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick pretences, but that it contains and Urges the most <hi>Essential Maximes</hi> of Christianity, and divots to the true and certain Methods of attaining to that which is the end of all <hi>Regilion,</hi> I mean, the pure Love of GOD; But to Evince this yet further, I shall Subjoin another passage out of a great <hi>Devotionist</hi> of the passed Age, which will both illustrat yet more and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:104909:305"/> this Heavenly Theologie. It consists, saith he, in knowing GOD and contemplating him, in dying to self, and to all things in order to be united to him, and to live in him. And this comes to pass, when the Soul of Man, in a generous disdain of all things, Soares above them, and by a Renuciation of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which might prove hinderances to it in this Noble pursute, takes no thought of enjoying any thing but GOD, and desires nothing but to be united to him by Love, and to please him. And hence it is, that this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which we make the <hi>Mystical Divinitie</hi> more especially to consist, cannot be <hi>obtain'd</hi> until that one hath first rooted out all the Vices, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Divine vertues in their place, and calmed the tumult of the passions which trouble the internal eye, and put the Soul out of a capacity to see GOD; For as <hi>GOD</hi> is a most pure Spirit, so he cannot be seen or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:104909:305"/> but by pure minds. But when the heart is purified from its Vices, it can without difficultie raise up it self to GOD, as to its true Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and it is as Natural for a Soul in this state to Sally towards its Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, as it is for a flame to mount upwards.</p>
                     <p>It is easie to infer from this, that in order to attain to this Union of the Soul of Man, with the Spirit of GOD, neither Books, nor Doctors, nor Subtility o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Spirit are Necessary; For there is no need here of <hi>great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or great study, God</hi> alone being as it were the <hi>Master</hi> who teaches this <hi>divine Science,</hi> or who Comunicats this Gift to purified Souls, and especially to the Humble, according as our Lord assures us in that Solemn Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Soul to his Eternal Fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note place="margin">Matt. 11.25.</note> I <hi>thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and hast revealed them to Babes,</hi>
                        <pb n="504" facs="tcp:104909:306"/> that is, to the Humble and Simple. This Science how Sublime soever it is, is yet common, both to the learned and unlearned; And even it often comes to pass, that they who know nothing, and are very simple, do nevertheless make greater advances in it; because their affections, which are not engaged in the Curiositie of Sciences, Being more easily drawn towards GOD, they acquire an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental knowledge of Divine things, that is much greater and far beyond that of several persons who by study and labour have attain'd to a high degree of knowledge. The reason is, that the <hi>Mystick Divinitie,</hi> not consisting in Theorie, nor in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Speculations, Subtilitie of Spirit is not needful to it, but puritie of heart, and a pure love to GOD, that is, a love disingaged from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and which Exercises it self, in a daily self denyall, and Renunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things, whereby it becomes
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:104909:306"/> more and more pure and Desecated.</p>
                     <p>But thô this incomparable Science, and this Union with GOD, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thus common to all, this doth not however diminish the esteem that one ought to have for it; For tho we have affirmed that it may be common to all, yet it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that it is so in very deed, since unhappily there are so few who aspire after this Blessed State; And so few who arrive at it. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is certain that it metits rather to be the object of our Researches than all other things; For when one hath once attained to this state of Union, he sees no more any thing, neither in Heaven nor on Earth that he can desire, and as long as he is at a distance from it he shall find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world that is capable to give Him satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>In effect, what is more noble or more excellent than this Union with GOD, or this Mystick Divinitie,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:104909:307"/> which is the pledge of future Glorie, and a prelude to that inaffable Joy which the Blessed Ones above do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit. This Divine Science ought to have the first place among all others; For whereas the other Sciences are purely Humane, this hath no other Object but GOD himself, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of whom it is wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. The effects of other Sciences are so little profitable, and continue for so short a time, that they end with the life of him who hath consumed the most part of his years in acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. But the <hi>Mystick Divinity</hi> fills the Soul with abundance of Spirituall good things, and makes it to drink in the source of the Divine Essence, where when one hath once drunk, as the Scripture speaks<note place="margin">John 4 14.</note>
                        <hi>he shal thirst no more.</hi> It brings alongs with it so great advantages to man, that it reforms &amp; renews him intirely both without and within. It communicats such excellent graces to the Interiour, that
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:104909:307"/> the Soul seeing it self surrounded with all sorts of riches, it believes that it is in a state where it hath want of nothing. Thus he.</p>
                     <p>What I have here declared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Love of GOD and man, and the methods prescribed in the Gospel for attaining them, is visibly of such importance, that I need use no further reasonings to urge the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of inculcating these great things timously &amp; diligently on the youth; for it is certain that to beget the love of GOD in their hearts, to advance them to higher and higher measures of it, and to keep them in it, ought to be the chief and principal stope, and butt of all our endeavours with regaird to them. Whatever we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to them that doth not tend to lead them to this soveraign end, and to turn their hearts and desires more and more towards the Author of their Beeings, and Source of their happiness, must undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:104909:308"/> be of very little value.</p>
                     <p n="6">6th. Another weighty point I mention is, that great Rule of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality<note place="margin">Matt. 7.12.</note>
                        <hi>All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.</hi> This Maxime, to which the Light of Nature it self bears witness, our Lord adopts into the Gospell-Law, and Recommends it to all his followers as another <hi>Summarie</hi> of the Law and the Pro: phets, in so far as they teach our duty to man. And it is certain that we ought not to neglect to allow it a place among those Earlier Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which we give the Youth. I do not at all doubt but the not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to Root this Maxime in their Hearts while they are Young, and not obliging them betimes to live according to it, may be one great cause of these abominable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justices and Oppressions, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound even in the Christian World, to the shame and Reproach of our
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:104909:308"/> holy Religion; For there are a great many, who pretend still to retain a mighty Zeal for the Honour of <hi>God,</hi> for his Interests and Cause, who yet make no scruple to Trample on all the Dictats of this great Rule of Christian Justice, and Imagine that their Piety is sound and entire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, tho it be attended with this very Essential Defect. <hi>So do to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as we would be done by,</hi> is no more Regarded by the Religious Factions, than if it made no part of the Christian Religion, or, then if it were some little petty Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that ought to be dispensed with, when their Interests oblige them to take other measures.</p>
                     <p>The Palpable and almost Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Disconformity of men in their dealings with one another to this great Rule, is, amongst a great many other things, one full Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Degeneracie of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and abundantly Evinces, that
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:104909:309"/> the spirit of our Religion is sadly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, for this, if it did prevail, would dispose us to <hi>deal with others as we would be dealt by,</hi> whereas now scarce any Vestiges of conforming to this <hi>Sacred Aphorism</hi> can be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Without doubt one excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent mean to Retrieve the Practice of it would be, to train up the Youth under a deep Sence of the Importance of it, and to teach them betimes to Square their carriages towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers according to it.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time we are carefully to remember, that in order to Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise this Maxime as we ought, the Love of God must Regulat the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of it, for this is that noble principle which directs to the most generous and purest Measures in dealing by others. 'Tis it that will give us the truest and most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Comentarie on this precept of our Redeemer, and teach us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it both in the most extensive
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:104909:309"/> and in the most excellent manner, whereas corrupt Nature, being a blind and partial, and selfish prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, will incline either not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it at all, or dictat very falsly or imperfectly concerning it. The Love of God illuminats the Soul in which it dwels, and inspires it with Just and Charitable inclinations, and as it knows the Measures which the Gospel Prescribes in dealing by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, so it very Faithfully Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modats it self thereto. He that is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated by Divine Charitie, states himself in the Condition of others, and gives every body the same Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he would expect from them, if he were in their Case. <hi>He Rejoyces</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom: 12.15</note>
                        <hi>with them that Rejoyce, and weeps with them that weep. He Remembers them that are</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Heb. 13:2.</note>
                        <hi>in Bonds as Bound with them, and them which suffer Adversity; As being himself also in the Body;</hi> And consequentlie Lyable to the same Calamities with
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:104909:310"/> others. He bewails the impenitent, reproves the Sinner, Instructs the Ignorant, comforts the Dejected, supports the Weak, Relieves the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous, visits the Sick, or in <hi>Jobs</hi> words,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Job. 29.12, 13, 15, 16.</note>
                        <hi>He delivers the poor that cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeth, and the Fatherless, &amp; him that hath none to help him. The blessings of such as are readie to perish come upon him, He causes the Widows heart to sing for joy. He is eyes to the blind, and feet to the Lame.</hi> In a word, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours as far as is possible to have the same Sense of the Miseries of Men, that they have themselves, and Administers according to his Abilitie, the assistances that are propper to their Respective conditions, as if the case were his own. And as he this labours to feel and relieve the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of the several cases of Men, so moreover he views himself as cloathed with the several Relations, in which others do stand with <hi>Respect</hi> to him, and carries to them as duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:104909:310"/> and bears their infirmities with as much tenderness and pity, as he could wish they should do him; If he stood so related to them.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A seventh important particular I mention, is that Solemn Gospel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, <hi>Come</hi>
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">Mat: 11.28, 29, 30.</note>
                        <hi>unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Rest. Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart; And you shall find rest unto your Souls; For My Yoke is easie, and My burden is Light.</hi> Some of the foregoing Heads of Christian Doctrine, did present us with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgments of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp; now in these words is Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited a compend of the Gospel, for here we have the Gracious <hi>Calls</hi> that it gives, The <hi>Precious Promisses</hi> it makes, the <hi>Excellent Terms</hi> it Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and in fine, these Terms Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended from their being very Easie, and Agreeable, and the whole contained in a few plain Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, so that it would seem it had
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:104909:311"/> been intended as a compendious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the Christian Religion, such as would not burden the Memorie nor puzle the understanding, and which by the endearing sweetness of its strain, is very accomodat to catch the heart. and engage the affections. And therefore very suted to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of the <hi>Youth,</hi> and most proper to season their minds, and which Consequently ought to be made Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to them, and its import Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently urged on them.</p>
                     <p>Come <hi>unto Me all ye that labour &amp; are heavy Laden,</hi> this is the Sum and Substance of the Gospel Calls. Here our Blessed Redeemer doth with a great deal of Tenderness and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on invite all <hi>that labour and are havie laden,</hi> that is, such as toil and disquit themselves in vain and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious pursutes after Satisfaction in created things and pleasures, such as are burdened with uneasie and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cares, such as penitently groan
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:104909:311"/> under the sense &amp; weight of the guilt and power and impurities of sin, and vehemently long for deliverance, such I say, the Holy <hi>Jesus</hi> invites to <hi>come unto him,</hi> that is, to enter into his Schooll, to become his Disciples, to Resign themselves to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Instructions, to learn the Lessons he sets before them, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his cures, to depend on his Grace and Merits, and in a word, to carry sutably to all these Relations which he bears as their Redeemer. And all that are in these Dispositions he assures that <hi>he will give them rest,</hi> that is, he will satisfie their desires, solace their sorrows, Relieve them of their Burdens, heal their distemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, cleanse them from filthiness, deliver them from their slavery, procure and apply their pardon, and finally advance them to a state of endless and perfect happiness; And this is again the marrow and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the great <hi>Promises</hi> of the
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:104909:312"/> Gospel. And as to the Terms of it, they were Figurativly and more generally expressed by the Phrase of <hi>coming unto him;</hi> But we have them more distinctly and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set down in these words, <hi>Take my Yock upon you, and learn of Me,</hi> that is, obey my precepts, and set me before as your Patern, Transcribe the Divine vertues I exemplifie unto you, and especially conform to me in the Graces of <hi>Humility and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> on which I put so dear value, and whereof I give you a Lively and continual Copie in all my Carriages: Our Lord calls his Commandments a Yoke, because they Check and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain our corrupt inclinations, and oblige us to make constant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severeing Resistances unto them, as also to endeavour to attain these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious dispositions which suppose and require the expulsion and crucifixion of the vicious habits and tendencies of our degenerat natures. But then
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:104909:312"/> he tells that the task which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes his Disciples are <hi>light and easie.</hi> Certainly they are so to all those ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Souls who are invigorated by the Love of Jesus, and assisted by his grace, and such all his Faithful fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers are; For tho the precepts <hi>and Counsel of the Gospel be hard and severe</hi> sayings to flesh and Blood, because they urge the extermination and death of the Old Man, yet this Heroick passion will render all the uneasinesses that appear in them agreeable and pleasant, and make those in whom it lodges cheerfully to leap over all difficulties.</p>
                     <p>From this it is undenyably Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that to Represent the Gospell as an absolute promise or Covenant, which hath in it no conditions at all to be performed on our part, or to establish such conditions of it as plainly exclude the necessity of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the precepts of our Redeemer, and of the imitation of his Life, is sadly
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:104909:313"/> to impose on, and delude the Souls of men. Such wild and deceitful accounts of the Gospel, as these are contradicted by every other page of the new Testament, and are visibly contrivances in favour of the Old Man; For our corrupt Natures love extreamly to be flattered, and that the way to Heaven be made smooth, and Easie, and so wide that one may walk in it without being obliged to do violence to his Lusts: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these pernicious infusions the Youth ought to be carefully garded, as against so many dangerous Rocks, on which, if they are not aware of them, they may split and perish.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. In fine, the great <hi>Promisses</hi> of the Gospel, and the opposite <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings,</hi> shall be the last Capital point of Christian Doctrine, that I would offer as one of the principal things in which the Youth ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed betimes, for these are very capable to work on their Hopes and
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:104909:313"/> Fears, to engage them in an earlie Pietie, and to excite them to diligence and Fervour: Now the <hi>Promisses</hi> that I intend, are especially these two.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Promise of the Holy Spirit,</hi> which we have set down in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable words of our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our<note n="(a)" place="margin">Luk: 11 1</note>
                        <hi>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: How much more will your Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly FATHER give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> It is the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Gospel <hi>Oeconomie,</hi> that it is the <hi>Aministration of the Spirit,</hi> and and it is the Priviledge of all sincere Christians, not in one only, but in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie Age, to have this promise made good to them, that is, truly to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Holy Ghost, which becomes in them a Living Source, or principle of puritie, and Healing of Life and Power, of Wisdom and Counsel, of Joys and Consolations, and in a word of all Divine and Heavenly Graces, which therefore are called in Holy
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:104909:314"/> Scripture, the <hi>Fruits of the Spirit.</hi> But this hath formerly been insisted on at large. I shall only say at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that it will be Necessarie, very earlie to point out this promise to the Youth, and to enduce them as soon as may be, by Humble and Fervent Prayers to address their Heavenly <hi>FATHER</hi> for his Good Spirit, that He may come to Animat and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, to renew and Sanctifie their Souls, and in end inhabit them for ever, as His <hi>Living Temples,</hi> telling them with all, which is the opposite threatning, that as long as they are not under the influences and conduct of this blessed and adorable Spirit, they must Necessarily be under the power and slaverie and black inspirations of the Spirit of darkness and Corruption, that Spirit which<note n="(b)" place="margin">Eph: 2.2.</note> worketh in the Children of Disobedience, and who when he gets any in his clutches, will do all that is possible for him, to keep them under his Dominion, till
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:104909:314"/> he have made them as Miserable as himself.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other is the <hi>promise of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life;</hi> It is the Glorie and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the Gospel, that by it, <hi>Life and Immortality are brought to Light.</hi> It doth not give its Votaries, Assureances of Pomp and Grandeur, of Plenty and Fulness, of Honour and Preferment, &amp; of all these accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and Conveniencies that are Grateful to flesh and blood, Nay it tells them plainlie, that <hi>in the World</hi>

But then it give them a joyful prospect of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly more Excellent things, things muchmore worthy of their pursutes and affections, it entertains them
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:104909:315"/> with the blessed Hope of the never failing Glories of the other World. Now the precious Promises of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, are the Foundation of this Hope, and with these the Discourses of our <hi>Redeemer</hi> do abound. I shal only fix on two passage, one is,<note n="b" place="margin">Matt: 25.34</note>
                        <hi>Then shal the King say to them on His Right Hand, Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the World.</hi> The other we have in one of the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our <hi>Lords solemn Prayer,</hi>

Now to be obliged to <hi>depart</hi> from the presence of a Friend
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:104909:316"/> or Relation, whom we dearly Love, and who is verie comfortable and useful to us, cannot but be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie, but to be separated from the only Source of Bliss and Glory, of Life, and Light, and Joy, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely sinking must it be? Especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie considering that the place into which the Departure must be, is a state not of ease, but of pains and Torments, and those not light and tolerable, but sharp &amp; exquisit, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented here under the direful Emblem of dwelling in the midst of a scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire, and to be endured, not for a short time, but for ever, and that in the Company of the most unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and accursed Creatures, <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though Hell and the Nature of its Torments will fall in elswhere to be treated of in Prosecution of the design I have in hand, yet on this occasion I desire that the two or three following particulars concerning it
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:104909:317"/> may be Seriously Remarked.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That when one hath his lot in this Dreadfull place, it is the <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his own Choice,</hi> the Rule ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which the Righteous and Good <hi>God,</hi> hath Determined to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in his dealings with <hi>free creatures</hi> is to <hi>give everie one of them according to his works and choice.</hi> He sets life and death, Blessing and cursing before them, and commands them to choose for themselves. He will never <hi>violent</hi> their wills, nor constrain them to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. He makes use of no other force with them, but that kind, and sweet and agreeable One of his Love and Grace, and the Blessed &amp; Benign methods which they dictat; For to use such a force as would either abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely destroy or Render useless their libertie, would be evidently to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict and subvert the designs that he hath on free creatures, which is to receive a free, and cheerfull and Voluntarie love and obedience from
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:104909:317"/> them, that he might delight himself with them, and make the fullest and most abundant communications of his Light and Joys unto them. Indeed because he knows the strength and byasses of the corruptions and lusts of men, and the force and cunning of the powers of darkness, which make continual oppositions unto them, he leaves no mean Unessayed to oblige them to choose the <hi>better part,</hi> and Graciously Ministers unto them the assistances of his Almightie Spirit, with which if they join issue, they will quickly be Enabled gloriously to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat and triumph over all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, so that it may on good grounds be said <hi>what more could</hi> (a) <hi>he have done to his vineyard,</hi> in a consistency with his Justice, and with the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations he hath made of the methods of his procedure with free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent creatures, that he hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie done. But then if men wilfully continue to neglect His calls, &amp; refuse
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:104909:318"/> his offers, to slight his warnings, and resist his Spirit, he gives them up to their lusts, and leaves them to follow their own counsels and choice. It is true, none will own that he makes choice of damnation, but it is certain that he who chuses the way, chuses also the end to which it leads, and therefore he that deliberatly chuses a sinfull vicious and an impenitent life, doth in effect chuse damnation; For this latter is as necessarlie a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the former, as being burnt inevitably follows upon ones casting himself into the fire, nay the one fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owes much more necessarly than the other; For GOD can by his power Suspend the efficacie and force of the fire, but it is absolutely impossible, that he can unite with polluted and defiled Souls, whol run away from, and hate his Light and Purity, and have no dispoitions to receive or relish the communications of his love. It is plain, then that ones being cast
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:104909:318"/> into Hell, is entirely owing to his own choice: All the damned might, had they been Faithfull to the Grace of GOD, have evited the miseries that they must endure; There were no hidden fates hanging over their heads, that inevitably determined them to make this sad choice, they did it freely and of their own accord, and in a sturdy opposition to all the lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remonstrances of Heaven, to imagine such eternal decisions as do particularly, personally, and irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly doom the far greatest part of Mankind to Damnation, and do leave them, tho they are in a state of Tryal, and have the means of Grace and Salvation offered unto them, not the least possibility of escaping the <hi>Bottomless Pit,</hi> is, if the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine were followed up to its direct, its genuine and Native, its most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and most immediat Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, down right to subvert and overthrow all Religion, to dishon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other thing I would have Remarked is, that Men put a Cheat on their Souls, if they should hope that they can Escape the miseries of the other World, when they go out of this life, carrying the very principles and Causes of Damnation in their Bosoms, I mean when they live and dy in a state of Impenitencie, and under the power of Corruption, when their vicious habits and deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inclinations, their Earthliness and Sensualitie, their Pride and Self Love, their Malicious and Revengeful Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions continue to be still Lively
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:104909:322"/> and vigorous in them, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever used any serious Endeavours to get them Mortified and expelled their Souls, for these are the true causes of Damnation, and do Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and necessarily plung Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that dreadful state. Hell is the only Element that is suted to Souls of these Dispositions, and to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the merits and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Redeemer will procure the Pardon and Salvation of such is deplorable to Mistake the designs of his coming into the World, which were first to destroy by his power and Grace the Works of the Devil in the Souls of Men, and by so doing to Qualifie them for the Enjoyments of Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Tho the <hi>Fear</hi> of Hell and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be not so Noble and Generous a principle of Religion, as the <hi>Love of GOD</hi> is, yet it is here commonly that Pietie takes it use,<note place="margin">Prov: 1.7.</note> and therefore it is very necessary that the
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:104909:323"/> Miseries of the Damned be seriously Represented to the Youth, to the end they may have their due effects upon them, that is, beget in them a deep Hatred of Sin, and engage them to abandon these Inclinations and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, the Consequences whereof are so Fatal and Terrible. And propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionallie as they advance in Religion, and Experience the Joyes and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of it, the other nobler princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will take place, and give more filial and Diviner formes to their obedience and devotions.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have pitched on these great and capital points of the Christian doctrine, which ought more especially to be imparted and recommended to the youth. And I have not contented my self barely to relate them, but that I might prevent the mistakes that are commonly intertain'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, I have in some Meas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures explained them, and to the best of my understanding, I have given just
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:104909:323"/> and true representations of them Now I shall proceed to the.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV And last particular, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to consider under this Head, Namely, <hi>the suitableness of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Son of GOD, in order to advance the design of his Incarnation,</hi> which, as we have already declared, was the Restoration of Man to his Primitive Bliss and Glorie, or the making him immed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>tly Capable of the Fruition of GOD, his Soveraign Happiness and End. Now the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine is admirablie fitted for promoving this great design, both by way of <hi>Direction</hi> and <hi>Motive.</hi> All the Precepts of the Gospel are so many Excellent <hi>Directions,</hi> which clearly point out to us, everie step of the way to Bliss, and in following them faithfully, we will in end Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily arrive at our desired Haven, They are not <hi>Arbitrarie Impositions,</hi> meerly intended for the Tryal of our Obedience, but Excellent and Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:104909:324"/> remedies contrived by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisdom to answer the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Lapsed Natures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd for their Restoration and Healing. Each one of 'em hath in it a great deal of of Reason and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and secret Vertue, and which, when duly applyed, will effectually work the cure, they are all calculated either to remove the Hinderances of our Happiness, or to implant in us these Dispositions that Qualifie us for it. Now the <hi>Hinderances</hi> of our Happiness, are our Flesh and Blood and corrupt Nature, our Lusts and Passions, the Pleasures, Riches, Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and customes of the World, the Temptations and Devices of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and therefore the Precepts that enjoyn Self-denyal, bearing the <hi>Cross,</hi> contempt of the World, the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion of our Lusts, and resisting the Devil, are visibly suted to take these Hinderances out of the way. One the other hand, Puritie and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:104909:324"/> Meekness and Charitie, and the love of God, and the other Christian graces that must subsist in the other World, are the Dispositions that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie us for bliss, whence it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the precepts which urge them on us in this veiw, and require that we be endowed with them, are Singularly Accommodat to beget them in us.</p>
                     <p>And as the Christian Doctrine is thus Excellently suted to advance the designs of the Incarnation by way of Direction, it is so also by way of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> For it furnishes such powerful Considerations to urge and press the following its Directions, that it would seem impossible the force of them could be resisted by any that are at the Pains, seriouslie to look unto them. And as its Directions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in its Precepts, so its Motives are Exhibited to us on the one hand <hi>in great and precious Promises,</hi> and on the other in dreadful <hi>Threatnings,</hi>
                        <pb n="542" facs="tcp:104909:325"/> which Lovingly foretell what will be the Deplorable Fate of such as Neglect to obey; Tho' also all these Gracious Declarations of the Love of GOD to Mankind, all the surprizing Condescendencies of the blessed JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS in his Life and Death, which the Gospel informs us of, may and ought to be improven into Motives to gain us to the practice of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Precepts of our Religion, and even these verie Precepts, considering that they require nothing of us, but what is infinitly our interest that we should do, are in themselves mightie and verie enforcing Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sives to oblidge us to order our hearts and Lives according to them.</p>
                     <p>The suitableness of the Doctrine of the Son of GOD to advance the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of his Incarnation is of it self so evident, and the particulars that hitherto have been declared concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Sacred Doctrine do so fully Demonstrat it, that I shall not need
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:104909:325"/> to insist on it at more length, only I would have this improvement made of it with regard to the Youth, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that when any Doctrines are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded on them, as being the Doctrins of the Son of GOD, and when they cannot descern a sutableness and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie in them to advance the blessed design we have spoke of, they have very good reason to suspect that they are none of His. The great and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Character of all the Doctrines that he delivered, is, that they have in them an admirable fitness to carry on and promove these gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, which oblieged him to assume our Mortality, and when it sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears that this Mark is wanting in any Doctrines, it is a very just pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice against them, if not a plain dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverie of their falshood, Or at least, that they are of no great moment in the Christian Religion. And if the truth and value of some of these doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, that severals do Fondly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:104909:326"/> were examined according to this measure, I perswade my self, that a great many of them would fall to the ground, either as wholly false or very useless. But now it is time that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the consideration of the</p>
                     <p>Third Great Mean which our <hi>glorious Redeemer</hi> hath imployed in order to carry on the designes of his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,<note place="margin">Tbirdlie, The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, as the great mean of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the designs of his Incarnation, is insisted on, and recommended.</note> and that is his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</hi> Now tho this most weighty and important par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular be one of the chief and principal things which the Intructors of Youth ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in their endeavours to educate them in the Christian Religion, yet unfortunately, it so falls out, that scarce any notice is taken of it in prosecuting that affair. For the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and self flattering views, that Men have got of the designs of the Gospel, and of the Nature of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption which is published therein,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:104909:326"/> have so fatallie imposed on, and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assed their understandings and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they can see no necessity of insisting on, and Recommending this great point; Though the truth is, it contains the most Essential du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Religion, and urges them on us with a new Force, and in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances that are very Endearing. 'Tis the <hi>Example</hi> of our ever Blessed Redeemer that will furnish us with the truest and most genuine Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries on his Heavenly Doctrines; For in it we have as it were a <hi>New</hi> or <hi>Second Edition</hi> of these excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Divine Graces, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered and Recommended in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Sermons, set off with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of verie Lovely and Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Cuts and Figures, which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly help us to Conceive a Right of the import of his Sacred injunctions, but also powerfully engadge us to conform unto them. In effect the Christian Graces are so Exquisitly cut
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:104909:327"/> out and shaped, and set before us in so lively and taking a manner, in the Life and Death of the <hi>holy Jesus,</hi> that if we keep our Eyes seriously fixed on him, it will not be possible for us either to mistake the Nature, or omit the Practise of them. In short it is this Blessed <hi>Example</hi> which acquanits us with these great things, the living and vital practise whereof is what Essentially constituts a sincere Christian, what peculiarly characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizes the <hi>True Followers of the Lamb,</hi> and distinguishes them from the rest of the World. And therefore it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyably Evident, that to set before the Youth the Example of their dear Redeemer, to Explain and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to them, and to initiat them as soon as is possible, into the imitation of it, ought to be Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as one of the principal Concerns of a Christian Education; And since it is so, I should think that my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Province I have
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:104909:327"/> undertaken would be very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and defective, if I had either quit omitted Treating of it, or but Superficially and slightly touched it.</p>
                     <p>And that I may Contribut the best Assistance I can to Parents and Instructers of Youth for Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging this part of their Task Succesfully, I think, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Observe the following Method. I. To Evince that our Blessed Saviour hath given an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> or Copie which all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers are obliged to Transcribe and imitat. II. To deduce in some particular instances the great things that he hath Exemplified unto them and to which he doth more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally require their Conformity. III. To declare the necessity on the one hand of his giving such an Example, and on the other of their conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and imitating it. And in fine, from the discussion of these
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:104909:328"/> particulars, to oblige them to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, both the Admirable Wisdom of fixing on this mean, and how powerfully it Conduces to promove the designs of the Incarnation.</p>

Now the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, not only frequently
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:104909:328"/> and fully assert that our Redeemer hath given us an example, but also proposes it for our imitation, and Strictly and Solemnly require our conformitie thereto. Some notable passages to this purpose must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; I begin with what our Lord himself hath taught us concerning the matter. He is indeed full and frequent, and express upon the Head; <hi>Learn of Me,</hi> saith he<note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat: 11.29.</note> For <hi>I am Meek and lowly in heart,</hi> where it is plain, that he would have his Disciples to eye him as their Patern, and to learn the Divine Lessons that he Teaches them by his own Example, not in a meerly Notional and Speculative manner, but by a <hi>Living and Practical Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> The same is also plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough implyed in the frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, which he gives to <hi>follow him. He that taketh</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Mat 38,</note>
                        <hi>not his Cross, and followeth after Me, is not worthy of Me.</hi> 'Tis true the word
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:104909:329"/> in the Original which is Translated here <hi>to follow,</hi> doth not strictly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to conform <hi>to a Patern;</hi> There is indeed another word which prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly hath that meaning, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes use in this same affair, of which afterwards. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>to follow,</hi> both in this passage, and in a great many more, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to represent the duty of a Disciple, and consequently neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily includes <hi>Imitation,</hi> for to be a Disciple, especially in the Gospel Sense, imports an obligation to Trace the footsteps of a Master, and to conform to his Practices and Example, his temper and Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to his state and Circumstances; That this is so, is abundantly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from those words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in St. <hi>John</hi>

Another convincing proof, of this we have in that other famous passage of this same <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist</hi>

                     <p>These passages, without needing to add any more, do sufficiently Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablish the Truth which we were obliged to Evince. In effect the
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:104909:331"/> Son of GOD <hi>appeareth in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sinful Flesh,</hi> not only that he might Propitiat and Merit, but also that he might give an example; For if he had not had this in his prospect, considering the incompar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Excellencie, and Supereminent dignity of his Divine Person, he might, it would seem, have Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched his Meritorious and Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatorie work in a short time. But because he would in his own prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice leave a Living patern of that Excellent Religion which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the World, therefore he chused not only to take our Nature upon him in a state of Frailtie and Mortalitie, and exposed to all sorts of sufferings, and Temptations, and discouragements, but also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this afflicted state for a tract of many years, both that he might exemplifie unto lost mankind the methods and means of recovering the love and fruition of God, and
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:104909:331"/> Encourage to the practice of them, and that by having experience of their Miseries and Temptations, he might Graciously pity them, and Minister seasonably to their releif. The Devout <hi>Arndius,</hi> who Zealous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie urges the <hi>Imitation</hi> of our blessed Saviour, without derogating any thing from his infinit Merits, gives us his thoughts concerning the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject we are treating of in these <hi>words.</hi>

                        </note> whom I had once and again occasion to mention. And because the passage is put to my design, I think it worth my while to Translate and insert it here. <q>If saith he, Jesus Christ had appeared to the World in such a Glorious Body as he did to <hi>Adam,</hi>
                           <pb n="558" facs="tcp:104909:333"/> or in that same Body, but covered with a cloud, he could not have conversed with Men, nor accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish among them, the design which he had undertaken. And if he had conversed with them, without feeling any thing of their Calamities and disadvantages, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bodily or Spiritual, his being among them in these Circumstanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, would have been so far from animating them to the imitation of him, that this disproportion would have extreamly discouraged them. It was necessary therefore that he should feel our sorrows and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, our infirmities and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Violence and force of the inclinations of lapsed nature to the end that he might combat and overcome them, and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age us to do the like, and that all sorts of Tempted Persons, might find in him their Maladies born, conquered and heal'd, and that
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:104909:333"/> none might Fancie a Dispensation from Combating them under the pretence of infirmitie, and that in fine, himself might know by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience how he ought to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his Mighty Assistances, and Compassions to the temptations of men, after having had tryal of their Violence.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But because our <hi>old man,</hi> our Flesh and Blood, our lusts and corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations will be ready to suggest pretences and grounds whereby to excite us from the imitation of our Redeemer, and so betray us to abandon the great mean which our Heavenly Father hath granted us in Order to fit and prepare us for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Readmitted into our forefeited Bless; It will not be amiss here briefly to take some of the most spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of them out of the way. that so the Youth may receive no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice by them.</p>
                     <p>One of these pretences is our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:104909:334"/> some will say, was GOD, and therefore to pretend to imitat what he did, and suffered in our Humanitie, may Justly seem great Arrogance and Presumption. There is indeed here, an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and shew of Humilitie, but it is false and illusive, that Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie that would exeem from the performance of the great and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental duties of our Religion can never be true and Genuine. It is true our Redeemer was GOD, But that Nature which suffered and did wrestle, was not God, it was of the same Make and Constitution with Ours, Frail, Mortal, and Sensible.

                        <hi>yet
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:104909:334"/> did He not take on Him the form of a Servant?</hi> And put himself in a state, wherein he was obliged to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey? And the more to encourage us to the imitation of him, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of the possibilitie of so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did he not <hi>Empty Himself,</hi> and lay aside his Glory? Did he not put Himself in our Circumstances, and felt our Miseries and Weaknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses? Was he not assaulted by our Temptations? And in a word, did He not approach us as near as was possible for Him, without becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actually Criminal and Guilty? And after all this, dar we say, that His being GOD, is ground enough to excuse us from conforming to that Amiable Patern, which he, during his abode in our Mortal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath set before us, and so to Palliat our wretched sloath and Cowardice.</p>
                     <p>However, some will yet say, and it is another pretence, our Redeemer
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:104909:335"/> as Man was personallie United to the Divine Nature, and therefore as Man he had assistances that none other can pretend to, or hope for. That <hi>God</hi> was thus United to our Saviour as Man is most certain, but then this Union did not change the Nature of his Humanity, he was still verie Man, and even a Frail, and Mortal Man, and as such his Faculties and actions were truelie Humane. When the Scriptures spake of Him in his state of Exina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Mortality, they do not represent Him as having an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, with all these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that Flesh and Blood are Fond off, but in a state of Depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Languor and infirmities. The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> gives us this account of him<note n="(a)" place="margin">Jsa: 53 2, 3.</note>
                        <hi>He hath no form nor comeliness, and when we shall see Him there is no beautie that we should, desire him. He is despised and rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Men.</hi> And in one of the
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:104909:335"/> Prophetical Psalms<note n="(b)" place="margin">Psal: 22 6.</note> He is <hi>brought</hi> in speaking thus of himself, <hi>I am a Worm and no Man, a reproach of Men, and despised of the People.</hi> So that his being united to the Deitie, did not exeem him from these Weaknesses and infirmities, that were Consequential to the assuming the Humane Nature in a state of Mortalitie.</p>
                     <p>It is moreover true, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Divinitie did by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, influences and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Fortifie, the Humanity of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>rist;</hi> But then it is also true, that that same GOD, who assisted, and gave force and power to the Humane Nature of our Redeemer, and who is alwayes equallie great and Almightie, doth also present himself to Man for his assistance, and will, when once He heartily engages, and Faithfullie continues in this blessed imitation, Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antlie carrie him through all the
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:104909:336"/> steps of it, and enable him to Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount all the difficulties that he may meet with in his way. Our Lord hath assured us, that our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father <hi>will give His holy Spirit to them that ask Him.</hi> That same Divine Spirit, that Spirit of <hi>Might</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> that rested on, that acted and influenced the Humanity of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> will be derived to all his Faithful followers, to all who sincerely endeavour to imitat and Transciribe the pattern that he hath set before them, and wil inspire them with Resolution, Courage and strength to Graple with all the Oppositions and Temptations, the difficulties and disadvantages where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they may be assaulted in Trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the footsteps of their dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. In effect there is a <hi>Divine force</hi> that ever accompanies the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> And they who devote themselves to it, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that it is so indeed to their
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:104909:336"/> infinit satisfaction and comfort, so much, I think, himself intimats in that known passage of His<note n="(a)" place="margin">John 8 12.</note>
                        <hi>I am the light of the World; He that followeth Me, shall not walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but shall have the Light of Life.</hi> A living Light shall be Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto him who seriously stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies conformitie to the Son of God; a light that hath Life and Efficacie in it, that not only illuminats and Warms, but Fortifies and Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borats. A faint ineffiacious light cannot issue from the <hi>Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> the Luminous Emanations of the Eternal <hi>Word,</hi> give Vigour and Sprightliness to those Souls, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they are admitted. So that upon the whole we may be fully satisfied, that there is no just reason why we should be discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged from the imitation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, for want of Divine assistances to carry us on in it. The mercifull GOD, to be sure, will never enjoyn
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:104909:337"/> us any Tasks, but what he will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us Grace to perform.</p>
                     <p>I shall not now enter upon the discussion of the false and deceitful Schemes which some give us of the Gospel, whereby this <hi>Imitation</hi> is either rendred useless, or Men dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned from it, or self flattering pretences suggested to them, which suffer them not to see any necessity of attempting it. I hope, I have sufficiently guarded against them alreadie, and therefore I proceed to the next particular.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Which is to <hi>deduce in some instances,</hi>

<pb n="567" facs="tcp:104909:337"/> whereof hath its own peculiar <hi>sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Beautie, Vertue,</hi> and <hi>efficacie;</hi> And when I approach one of them, I discover in it, such a relieving Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancie, so delicat a relish, such live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Coloures,</hi> that I begin to think none of the rest can compare with it, and yet when I come towards another, I find equal Excellencies in it, with the addition, only of an agreeable change; And so passing alongs them all severallie, I alwayes meet with a fresh intertainment, for I see a new Beautie, I taste a new sweetness, I feel a new Efficacie in each, and yet I am still in doubt, to which I shall give the preference, the qualities of each of 'Em are so singularly useful and Valueable. Such as this is the Divine Pattern which we are to Survey in its particulars. The life of the holy <hi>Jesus</hi> is as it were set round with the flowers of most Amiable Graces, whereof each hath its peculiar Excellencies and useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:104909:338"/> When we take a view of one of them, we think there is none that can parallel it, and yet the discoverie of another, furnishes us with equal Satisfaction and pleasure, so that it is hard to determine, which it is that must have the Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, so incomparable is the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that appears in each.

<pb n="569" facs="tcp:104909:338"/> and Happiness, as rough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant Exercises, but this is no Dishonour to them, no more than it disparages a well ordered and well furnished Garden, that a Swine will take greater pleasure in a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, than amidst all its delightful flowers.

                     <p>We are to take care, that we do not imagine, that these things, which the holy <hi>Jesus</hi> as our pattern hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for our imitation, are limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a few, only of his actions; For it is certain that in all he did and suffered from his assuming, the Humane Nature in a state of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, till he reassumed his Glory at the right Hand of his Father, Bearing only his miraculous opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which come not within the rank of imitable instances of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he gave <hi>us an Example, that we should follow his steps:</hi> But then we do not affirm, that all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and sufferings were meerly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarie, and no more. This is one
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:104909:340"/> of the Sacralegious assertions of the Socinians, whereby they prophanly derogat from the honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our adorable Redeemer, and which therefore we must reject with dislike and detestation. The truth is, as the notions which <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers have of the person of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and of the Methods which he hath taken to accomplish the Remption of the World, are generally perpetual mistakes, and the native off-spring of proud reason, nourished and blown up, with the Airie-quirks of Critical Learning, so the accounts which they give us, even of his Example, whereof they talk so much, are but Lame and defective. Lean and Superficial; For they speak nothing of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and mighty force, which ever accompanies it, and which power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie Exerts it self in all who reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely apply themselves to the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it. And their affected
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:104909:340"/> ignorance of the greatness of that corruption, which hath so deeply infected and defil'd fallen Mankind, doth incapacitat them to see the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent either of it, or of our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to it, and the Grounds and Necessitie of both.</p>
                     <p>We are to have a twofold view of the actions and sufferings of our Redeemer. One is, that they are infinitly <hi>Meritorious;</hi> For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that so glorious, so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and so Divine a Person, one so singularly dear to God, and so incomparably jealous for his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, so vastly Charitable to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and so vehemently desirous of their Salvation, and whose boundless and infathomable Love obliged him, in order to effectuat their Recovery, to debase himself to a degree that both amazes, and furnishes matter of praise and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to Saints and Angels, it is impossible, I say, that <hi>he</hi> could <hi>do</hi>
                        <pb n="574" facs="tcp:104909:341"/> and <hi>suffer</hi> without <hi>Meriting infinitly.</hi> And in this view, all his actions and sufferings are an unexhausted Source of precious and unvaluable <hi>Merits,</hi> and therefore, of pardon, Grace and Glory, and of all the means that lead to the fruition of it, in a word, of all the good things to be enjoyed either in time or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. We have spoke of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in this prospect, and shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them again with intention to declare, how full and firm the grounds of our <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Consolations</hi> are, what powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citments we have to love and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, what Obligation to Praise and Gratitude, what Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prayer, and how ineffably Glorious the provisions must be which these infinite Merits have procured for us.</p>
                     <p>The other view which we are to have of the actions and sufferings of the holy Jesus is, that they are
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:104909:341"/>
                        <hi>Exemplary,</hi> and consequently design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our Imitation. And this ought by no means to be separated from them. For, as shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be fully evinced, it is by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to them as they are <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary,</hi> that we shall partake in their blessed fruits and procurements, as they are <hi>Meritorious,</hi> They have been certainly very unhappy in their inventions, either who, on the one hand establish such a notion of the <hi>Merites</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our as plainly Cancels his <hi>Example,</hi> and the necessity of imitating it, and who on the other so insist on his <hi>Example,</hi> as to take no notice of his <hi>Merites.</hi> Both are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to be avoided, as most danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and fatal infusions. Having thus cleared our way, we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.</p>
                     <p>First what our Redeemer hath exemplified to us in his <hi>Life.</hi> And now we begin to open the Book of
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:104909:342"/> Life, out of which the Divinest Counsels, and most worthy of our acceptation will be presented to us. Now we enter upon the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where we shall see the Lovliest Scences acted, and to which it is our duty carefully to attend, that we may learn to re-act them with easiness and accuracie. Now we are unlocking the Garden, in which we shall have occasion to view the beautifull Flowers, that is, the Heavenly Graces and practices of the Son of GOD, the several kinds whereof we must diligently Labour to plant in our own hearts. And the</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I shal take nottice of, is <hi>his Contempt of the World.</hi> His holy Life was a perpetual and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted instance of this. How light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did he set by all these things which Flesh and Blood are so fond of! How generously did he trample on what ever corrupt hearts do so ambitiously court, pursue with such
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:104909:342"/> eager Researches, and hug and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace with so much passion! he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded and abandon'd honours and Greatness, Pomp and Splendor, Riches and affluence, Profits and Pleasures, Accomodations and Conveniencies. When he was to assume our mortal Nature, he did not pitch on a great Queen or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, one that made a figure, and was remarkable in the World, that was under the protection of the Mighty, attended with a Splendid Retinue, and rich in possessions to be his mother, but he chose a poor Virgin, and for the protector of his Infancie he took not a King or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentat, but a mean helpless Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And when he was to be brought forth into the World, he did not, as he might easily have done make magnificent preparations for Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing his Nativity, no stately Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, no Glorious Furniture, no numerous and Splendid attendants,
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:104909:343"/> no delicat entertainments were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for his Reception. His dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded Mother, either not being allowed, or not finding place in the Inn<note n="(a)" place="margin">Luk 2.7.</note> was obliged to Retire to a Stable, and there was delivered of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> in mean and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised Circumstances. And thus his first appearance on Earth was in a state of Destitution and Indigence, and in a direct opposition to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Customes and inclinations of the World. <q>Look well, saith <hi>Arudius,</hi> into his Life and Doctrine,<note place="margin">Intuere mihi ipsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us vitam &amp; Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinam, nec nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis nihil ipso &amp; mundo esse dissimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>and the Birds of the Air have Nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.</hi> He chose, while in this World, to live in a state of Poverty and meanness. <hi>Though he was Rich,</hi> saith St. Paul<note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Cor: 8.1.</note>
                        <hi>yet for our sakes he became poor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He courted not the smiles of the Great, nor the Protection of the Mighty, nor insinuated himself into the Friendship of their Favorites, that he might procure their Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations. He had an inviting opportunity to make his Court

                        <hi>he was filled with Wisdom, and the Grace of GOD was with him,</hi> and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but twelve years old, he made such sage returns to the Questions of the Doctors<note n="(e)" place="margin">Ibid. Ver: 46, 47.</note>
                        <hi>that all who heard were astonished at his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and Answers.</hi> Yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed himself, and after that one notable appearance of his in the Temple, he continued in Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Parents, and lived with them hidden, and unobserved till the thirtieth year of his Age, when in obedience to his Fathers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, he was obliged to enter on the publict Execution of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and to pursue the designs for which he was sent into the World. This Conduct of his is very oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit to the Spirit of Vanity and Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation; For they who are acted
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:104909:346"/> by that Spirit, cannot endure, if they have any notable accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or but fancy that they have them, they cannot endure, I say, to lurk and ly by unnoticed, but will readily catch all opportunities to set themselves off, to publish their parts, and make Parades, and by so doing, to engage as many as they can to admire and commend them.</p>
                     <p>He despised the <hi>Vain Learning</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the World. For we must not fancie that the holy <hi>Jesus</hi> had his head filled with Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal subtilties and Speculations, with numerous Distinctions, and accurat Definitions, framed according to Rules of Art, that he studied Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to acquaint himself with the several Systems and Schemes of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie,</hi> and with the other Sciences that the learned put such a Value on, or that he considered either them, or the Methods Prescribed for acquiring them, as the true ways
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:104909:346"/> and means to perfect his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to attain to the solid know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of either natural or Divine things. To form to our selves such an Idea of our Redeemer, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grosly to mistake him; For he design'dly put a slight on these vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, knowing verie well how na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallie they tended to blow up <hi>Men</hi> with pride and presumption, and a conceit of their own sufficiencie, and what vast prejudices they had done their Souls by immoderatly applying themselves to the pursute of knowledge, falslie so called, and by Methods which left the Grand and original evils of the inward Man, uncured and unremoved. For on the one hand, the <hi>Greeks</hi> by their pretended researches after Wisdom, <hi>became vain in their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings,</hi> and the <hi>Jewish Rabbies</hi> on the other by their Criticks and fabulous Traditions misunderstood the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Oracles, and made <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:104909:347"/> of GOD of none effect,</hi> and both turned irreconcilable and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent Enemies to that true and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Philosophie,</hi> which the Son of GOD brought into the World, and published by the preaching of the Gospel, a Philosophie which teaches the noblest Wisdom, and that uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly conducts to the true and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happiness. And the means which it prescribes in order to attain to the solid knowledge of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters it treats off; and which the blessed <hi>Jesus</hi> himself did ever Exemplifie and recommend, are self denyal, and Simplicitie, Purity and Humilitie, and fervent Prayers, is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing from an Heart surrendered to GOD, in vacuitie and emptiness. These are the Keys that unlock all the Mysteries of this Sacred <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus we see that our dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer was, throughout all His Life, a continual instance of the
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:104909:347"/> most eminent contempt of the <hi>World,</hi> and of all these things in it, which Pure, Blind, and mistaken Mortals, do so Vehemently desire, and so eagerlie Pursue. But for what end was all this? was it only to furnish us matter of Meditation? or that we might take occasion from it, to commend our blessed Saviour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out needing to proceed to the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Him? or shall we say that he did it in our stead, with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to discharge us from doing the like? Or, in fine, that it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for us to reap the Merites of his contemning the World, tho we never conform to him in so doing? though these are verie ridiculous and illusive pretences, yet they are the plain Language, if not of the Speculations and belief, yet most certainly of the Practices of too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who bear the Name of Christ; For their Conversations are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reverse of his.

                        </gap>t it would seem that Christians do not any more consider their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer as their Pattern, and that they are become insensible of their obligations to conform to him as such.</p>
                     <p>But some perhaps may imagine that tho' carrying at this rate, was necessary to our Redeemer in the quality which he bore, yet it is not
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:104909:348"/> necessary for us to carry so, and will in order to evince the no necessity, of conforming to his Example, in these instances, be ready to say more over, that many have had rich and affluent fortunes, and were surroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Pomp</hi> and <hi>Grandeur,</hi> have been the favorits of the great, bore honourable stations and preferments lived in the midst of applauses and commendations, were eminently Learned, and yet notwithstanding have been solidly Vertuous, and did not decline from the Christian Life and Spirit. It is our ignorance and partiallitie to our Lusts and corruptions that make us think and talk at this rate. It was necessarie that our Redeemer should live in the circumstances that we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that thereby he might the more effectually convince us how necessary it was, that we should live as he did. The truth is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever accounts we give of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:104909:349"/> of his contemning the World, that do not include our indispens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able obligation to conform to him therein, cannot chuse but be false and Destructive; For tho absolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaking, the Son of GOD was under no necessitie to become the Redeemer of Mankind, yet after that his boundless, and immerited Love engaged him to undertake the work of our Redemption, and in order thereto, to assume our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a state of Frailtie and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as on the one hand it was necessary that he should despise that he would have us to despise, and teach us by his own practice what these things are which hinder our happiness, which turn us from the Love of GOD, and give nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and vigour to our Lusts and corruptions, so on the other, it is unquestionably our duty to look unto him as our Pattern, and come as near the Copie that he hath given
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:104909:349"/> us as possibly we can.</p>
                     <p>Now that these things which our Redeemer did avoid and despise, are of this nature, that is, that they nourish and confirm our Lusts, and turn us from the love of GOD, and consequently are effectual hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of our happiness, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declarations concerning them, do abundantly Evince; For as to <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>great Possessions,</hi> and their ordinarie attendants, Pompe, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and State, and the rest, our Lord tells us<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matt. 6.24.</note> that <hi>we cannot serve GOD and Mammon,</hi> and upon the discoverie which the rich Man in the Gospel made of his Temper and Inclinations, and of the fatal effects which his great possession had on him, he takes occasion to deliver this Maxime to his Disciples<note n="(b)" place="margin">Mat: 19 23.</note>
                        <hi>Verily I say unto you, that rich Men shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly denounces a <hi>Woe to the rich</hi>

It is all one to him, whether it be Silver and Gold, or Meat and Drink, or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Books, or the sensual Ideas of Pleasure, or speculative Ideas. What Flesh and Blood are to a lustful person, and what Silver and Gold are to the Covetous, the very same are Chimerical I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas or a Librarie to the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, excepting only that this latter kind of Idols.

                     </p>
                     <p>These, and a great many more of the same Nature, are the too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Attendants of the Learning and Wisdom of the World; But then, if Human Sciences could be separated from these Inconveniencies which certainly is extreamly difficult to be done, one might innocently enough make them the Matter of his Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation now and then, especially when he looks into them, not with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to gratifie a vain curiosity, or to get a Reputation and a great Name, but with the pious and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Designs of doing Good to
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:104909:353"/> such as stand in need of Relief this way; For such is the Genius of the World at present, that there is no access to vast Numbers of Men, but by the way of Reasoning and Speculation, and it is a signal Art of Charity, in such as are qualified for doing it, to endeavour the reducing them to Christian Simplicity and the Mortification of vain Curiosity, which is the Method that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and the Example of our Saviour recommend unto us, to endeavour I say, the reducing them in a way suited to their Gust and Relish. And there is good Ground to think, that one Reason why God, who is <hi>willing that all should come to the Knowledge of the Truth,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore graciously condescends to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Means proportioned to the Dispositions and Capacities of each one, did raise up the Learned St. <hi>Paul</hi> that he might be Instrumental to convert the Philosophers of his
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:104909:353"/> time, by accosting them in their own Dialect and Methods. And hence himself tells us<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1.14.</note> That he is <hi>debitor both to the Greeks and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, both to the Wise and the Unwise.</hi> The Station and Charge with which he was invested, did oblige him <hi>to become</hi>

And indeed, since <hi>Atheists, Deists,</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines,</hi> imploy their Wit and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dishonour and reproach Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it is but Just that they should be beat back with their own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and be made sensible that the Cause of God and Religion hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly the Advantage on its side, and that all the sorrie Oppositions that they make unto it, are but so many evidences of the darkness of
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:104909:354"/> their minds, of their partiality to their lusts, and of their having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned the most universal and most Sacred Dictats of Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Tho in the mean time I am fully satisfied, that as the gross mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of those who profess to believe that there is a God, and who own the Christian Religion, their living as if there were no God, and their continual disregard to all the Precepts of the Gospel, have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the sluces to <hi>Atheism, Theism,</hi> and <hi>Libertinism,</hi> so the most effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual way to recover such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with these evils, would be, that Christians, and particularly, such as set up for Defenders of the Christian Cause, did themselves exactly lead their Lives according to the Rules of their excellent Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and were truely Devout and Serious, Humble and Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, Just and Charitable, Pure and Sober. This would be of greater Force to convince and reduce the
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:104909:354"/> wittie Gentile-men, than all the Reasonings in the World. Living Instances of Piety, and a Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is a just Transcript of the great Maximes of Christianity, have in them such Demonstrations of the Being of a GOD, and the certainty of Religion, as cannot be evaded by Tricks and Sophistry.</p>
                     <p>These and the like Pious and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Motives, may justifie one's looking into Humane Sciences. But then we must be infinitly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to guard against these very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous dispositions, and base ends, that will be apt to insinuat and gain ground upon us, both in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute and possession of them. And the Truth is, when we seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, how vastly uncertain, or false, or useless they are in most things, how exceedingly they distract our Minds, and divert them from their true Objects; <hi>That is,</hi> From GOD and Divine Things; How short our time is, and how
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:104909:355"/> many of these precious Hours that were given us, in order to prepare and fit our Souls for the Bliss and Glories of the other World, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted in acquiring them. How much our having our Heads filled with absurd and ludicrous Ideas, indisposes us for the admission of these Truths, which are Solid and Real and Satisfying, and how all these vanities about which we have spent so much time and travel, will disappear and evanish for ever, or become absolutely unprofitable at our entrance upon Eternity. And when, in fine, we call to mind what St. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath long since said of them.

                     <p>He denied <hi>his own will,</hi> this we are frequently and expresly assured of. <hi>I seek not mine own will</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Jo: 5.30.</note> saith he, <hi>but the will of the Father which hath sent me,</hi> and again to the same purpose<note n="*" place="margin">Jo: 6.38.</note>
                        <hi>I came down from Heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</hi> To which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages I add these notted words of his, wherewith he concluded that Address which he made to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a little before his Passion<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 22.42.</note>
                        <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, not my will but thine be done.</hi> O who can fathom the depth of the Love of Jesus! That match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and astonishing Love which made him, who was Perfect Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Purity, put himself in a State wherein he was obliged to deny his own Will! But for what end did he give us this surprizing Instance of <hi>Self-denyal?</hi> Was it only to furnish a Theme for our Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:104909:362"/> Was so noble a Coppy set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us only that we might look u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it? Or shall we say that we are no farther concerned in it than to reap the Merits of it? Did he so strictly deny his own Will, that we might follow ours with greater Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie? O far be it from the devout Followers of the <hi>Lamb</hi> to entertain such self flattering thoughts. It is indeed our Duty to meditat on this Instance of his <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> but then our Meditations on it must terminat in a careful Imitation of it. And though our LORD hath merited for us in denying his own Will, yet we cannot on solid Grounds hope to partake in what he hath merited, but in conforming to him by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming and renouncing our wills. The corrupt will of Man is the source of all sin, and to follow it is the short and assured way to Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. All our villanous lusts and passions, our vicious inclinations
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:104909:362"/> and appetites are nothing else but different appearances and postures of our depraved will. All the sins that we commltt either inwardly in our Hearts, or outwardly in our Lives, are but so many complyances with its wicked counsels and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions. This is the grand enemy of our Souls, and by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Devil hath such power over us, and leads us captive, and keeps us from the Love of GOD and from Happiness, for it is not possible that we can recover the Love of GOD, nor consequently be Happy in the Fruition of him, to which the Love of him is an essential and indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable Prerequisit, as long as our will is at variance with His. There can be no true Love, where there is a flat and direct opposition of Wills. An Union of Wills is necessarie to constitute a reciprocal or mutual Love. Now our corrupt wills, as such, can never unite with the Holy
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:104909:363"/> Will of GOD, and therefore we must deny and renounce it, we must not follow its motions, nor listen to its counsels, we must check and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict its inclinations and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, we must accustome it to yeeld and submit to, and acquiesce in all the Expressions of the Divine Will, both Preceptive and Providential, thô never so choaking and disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it, and must continue treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at this rate, till all its corrupt byasses expire and dye, and till by the Power of Grace it be renewed, and become one with the Will of GOD, willing nothing but what he Wills desiring nothing but what he Desires, loving nothing but what He Loves, and delighting in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what he delights in. It was to engage us to do this that our Redeemer hath set before us this endearing Instance of <hi>Self-denyal.</hi> He denyed his own will that he might teach us to deny and disclaim
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:104909:363"/> ours. And O how unbecoming is it, that the Members should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to the Head, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples carry otherwise than their Master, that he should deny his will, and they flatter and cherish and follow theirs, that he should ungainsayingly undergo whatever was imposed on him, and they kick and spurn and draw back, that he should meekly acquiesce in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, and they fret and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure and repine.</p>
                     <p>Another Instance of His <hi>Self-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> is, his not <hi>pleasing his Senses.</hi> He did not procure for himself, as he could have very easily done, these things that might delightfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain and gratifie his Seeing and Hearing, his Tasting, Smelling and Touching, no beautiful and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Objects, no Melodious Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, no Odoriferous Perfumes, no exquisit Delicacies, no closs and well furnished Chambers, no Beds
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:104909:364"/> of Downe, no soft and pompuous Apparel, no none of these things. He cautiously abstained from all these sorts of Satisfactions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himself with what was sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply necessary. The Circumstances that he chuse for himself in this World, were poor and low, and not calculated to afford sensual Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications. He passed the most of his Years with his Parents, Persons of a mean condition, who, we may suppose, were not furnished with the Means and Advantage of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pleasing the Senses. And when he appeared under a publick Capacity on the Theatre of the World, we shall still observe the same Self-denying Strain in him all alongs: A little Bread and Fish, and and<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 110.7.</note>

                        <hi>Pharisees</hi> maliciously suggested, but that by freely and familiarly eating and conversing with sinners, he might the more easily gain ground on their Hearts, engage them to become true Penitents, and so heal their Spiritual Maladies.

And besides we may remark, that our LORD did not fix on the sensible Pleasure which this fragrant Oyntment did afford, but presently improves it into a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of his approaching Death and Burial. <hi>She is come before hand,</hi> as St. <hi>Mark</hi> hath it,<note n="*" place="margin">Mark 14.8.</note>

<pb n="623" facs="tcp:104909:365"/> Change and Dissolution; This would certainly lessen and even damp their ensnaring Sweetness, and prevent their too deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Hearts. But though we may meet with some few and rare Interspersions of Pleasure in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that are given us of our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour's Life, which his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and charitable Inclinations to promove the Salvation of poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners made him comply with, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any self gratifying designs, and which that untainted purity that he ever preserved in his Heart, and his having nobly overcome the World, and all its vain delights, did set him above the reach of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any disadvantage from, yet doubtless he lived a Life of great Abstinence and Severitie.

<pb n="626" facs="tcp:104909:367"/> in denying himself the pleasures of Sense was, that by his so doing, his Followers might have a Liberty granted them, to take for themselves the delicatest and most gratifying Entertainments, both as to Eating and Drinking. I am sure his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Followers made not such self flattering improvements. St. <hi>Paul</hi> acquaints us with his own Practice, telling,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor: 4.27.</note> that <hi>He was in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</hi> He did not, it seems, dream of any Flesh-pleasing allowances to have been procured to him by the <hi>Self-denyal</hi> of his Redeemer, as neither did these Holy Souls, who for fear of falling short of Conformity to him in his abstinences, retired into the Deserts, and avoided the occasions, and abandoned the Advantages of gratifying their Flesh and Senses. Our blessed Saviour in going before
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:104909:367"/> us in the Paths of <hi>Self-denyal</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to absolve us from disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our several Satisfactions, but to engage us the more strictly to do it. He knew well that our Senses, now in this state of Degeneracie and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, are as so many Passages, by which the Devil and Sin and Creatures get entrance into our Hearts, and take up that room, and engross these Affections that of Right belong to GOD, and that by indulging our sensual Inclinations, we contract a wretched insensibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as to Heavenly Things, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see nor relish them, nor be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with them: That the true way to preclude access to these our great enemies, and to preserve our Souls in a State of Freedom and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, and so as they may be still capable of Divine Impressions and Communications, is to confine our Senses, as much as possible we can, to what is simply necessarie, and
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:104909:368"/> resolutely to deny them their inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinat cravings. He knew that as long as we are in this World, we are in a State of Tryal and Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and that to abound in sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al delights does not sute a peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Life, or a State of Tryal, in which we ought carefully to avoid, and not to invite and court temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. It was upon these and the like Accounts that our LORD did think fit to engage us by his own Example to the denyal of our Senses. But in the mean time, tho the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which he hath taught and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified unto us be very strict, yet it is not cruel; It obliges us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to disclaime what is hurtful and prejudicial to our Souls, not what is necessary to the support and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of our Life. What nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es our lusts, not what preserves our Bodies, yea and in case of habltual Tendernesses, or when our Spirits are exceedingly wasted through fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:104909:368"/> and travel, and exhausting imployes, it allows the use of these things which a more healthful and vigorous Constitution, and sedentary Life, may well spare. <hi>Drink no more water,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi>

                     <p>But further, he denyed his <hi>Ease.</hi> He lived a Life of continual Toil and Labour, his very Infancy was not exempt from uneasiness. He had no softning Baths wherein to cherish his tender Body, nor any Downes whereon to repose it. The Manger or hard Pavement of a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was his Cradle, and the Straw his Pillow.

                        <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> to Celebrat the Passover, and from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> back again to <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> which was a Journey that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired several Days to accomplish it.

<pb n="631" facs="tcp:104909:369"/> sort made use of in their Travels to the Holy City, when at any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from it. And during the time of his abode with his Parents, he did not pass his Years in Ease and Softness; For though we have no particular Accounts how he was imployed for a great part of his Life, yet we have ground in the general to believe that he learned and did work in his supposed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Trade; <hi>Is not this the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Son of Mary?</hi> Said his Country-men<note n="*" place="margin">Mark 6.3.</note> by way of reproach, which sufficiently intimats what in part his Occupation was, and that he gain'd his Living by hard <hi>Labour,</hi> and after his entrance upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Discharge of these Functions that were incumbent on him as our Redeemer, we are abundantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what Toils and Hardships he all along exposed himself to. We find him, in this Period of his Life, sometimes fatigued with long
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:104909:370"/> Journies, traveling from Village to Village, and from City to City, without ever imploying those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies that would render his Journies easie and pleasant, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that once for a little way <hi>he rode upon an Ass,</hi>

For I think, it is very evident, that the more easie and soft ones Life and Circumstances are, the less mindful he will be that he is in a state of Banishment, the less desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of recovering his forfeited Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and the less disposed to enter upon penitential and flesh crucifying Examples; His feeling no hardships and inconveniencies, keeps him in love with his present state, and with the things that minister to his ease, and makes him wish their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and loath to part with them.

O how short liv'd were his Triumphs in this World, and the little warmth of a springing Joy which he felt, how was it abated by his afflicting Prospect of the unbelief and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of an unkind World!

                     <p>And now since our Redeemer was exposed to continual Persecutions. ought his Followers to expect or desire Exemption from them?

                     <p>Again, our Redeemer suffered sadly in his <hi>Reputation,</hi> He was loaded with the most hideous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies.

                     <p>Thus it was with the harmless Lamb of GOD, these and such like were the Characters which the World entertained him: These were the deferences that were paid to his Divine Vertues, and the kind Constructions that were put upon his most Laudable Actions.

Alas it is a secret and latent pride, that makes us so sharply resent these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments which we think are made upon our Honour. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:104909:376"/> we think too highly of our selves, and of our own worth that we are so fond of the good Opinions of others, and that we cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest these charges that suppose weaknesses and imperfections to be in us.

It is indeed our Duty to carry so Unblamably and Innocently, as that none may have any just ground to asperse our Reputation; But then, if after all our Care and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, the mouths of Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors be set loose against us, we ought to beat all their reproachful Speeches in Humility and Patience, reckoning with our selves, That

                        <q>The Blessed JESUS, as a Devout Soul hath it, would needs denude him self of the Reputation of Sanctity,
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:104909:377"/> thereby to confound our shameful hypocrisie, which makes us seek before Men the Glory and Praise of that Goodness and Vertue, that Sanctity and Innocence, which we neither have nor practise, and which carrying us to hide and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse our vices by fair pretences, causes us to appropriat and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat to our selves unjustly and without ground all sorts of vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions.</q> And thus, as patient suffering in our Reputation, and bearing reproach in conformity to our Redeemer, is Just and Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; So also it is very advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it serves to very good Purpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, it is an excellent Instrument of Vertue; It obliges us to make se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reflections upon our selves to turn our Eyes inwardly, and there penitently to view the degeneracy and disorders of our nature, and our many sins, whereby we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly become the objects of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to encourage his Followers contentedly to embrace a state of disreputation, which though it be very Beneficial to them, yet it goes very much against the grain of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, he hath pronounced these consolatorie words,<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 5.11.</note>

                     <p>But moreover, the Holy JESUS endured the <hi>Treacherie</hi> and <hi>Desertion</hi> of Friends and Relations. The true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:104909:379"/> Friend was falsly dealt by, and the most affectionat Relation disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and abandoned.

So that he was left alone, without shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and without Sanctuary, and in the power of merciless and cruel hands. There was none to take notice of him, or minister unto him.
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:104909:379"/> No Friend to solace his Sorrows, no Advocat to plead his Cause. <hi>I looked for some to take pity,</hi> saith he,<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 69.20.</note>

                     <p>Thus, we see, the Blessed JESUS was deserted and forsaken of all. They that formerly pretended a Friendship for him, now kept at a distance, all his Acquaintance did disown him, and <hi>His Lovers and Friends stood a loof from his sore. He looked</hi>

And since this was the case with him, why should his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers be unwilling to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in this part of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? <hi>If the World,</hi> saith he, <hi>hate you</hi>

                        <hi>ye know that it hated me before
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:104909:380"/> it hated you?</hi> If he who was the Worlds best Friend met with so little friendships from it, why should they expect to be caressed by it? If he was betrayed, denyed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned by Friends and Favorites, why should the like treatments sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them? If he was left destitute of all Humane Supports and Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, is not this enough to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them to such a State? What tho their nearest Relations should disclaim them, and their most fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Friends and Confidents become careless of them, or turn their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Why should not all this be cheerfully born, since it was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's lot to be in the same Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances? Our LORD hath gone before us in this Destitution of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Friendship, and all its Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, that he might thereby teach us to be content, when our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father sees it necessary for us, to be without all created Supports and
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:104909:380"/> Solaces, and cheerfully to forego all Dependancies upon Creatures and the Arm of Flesh, to the end both that our Trust in GOD might be the more Pure and Undivided, and that also we might be delivered from the snares and dangers that very often attend the Friendships and Relations of the World. For it is certain that when we have Ground to expect that in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses and difficulties, we shall be supported and relieved by the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Interposals of Friends and Relations, we are prone to lean too much to them, and so our Trust in GOD is more broken and intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But when we are destitute of this kind of Subsidies, and left Hopeless, and without Hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any Relief from Creatures, our Recourse to the Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is more full and entire, and we learn to depend upon him absolutly for whatever we stand in need of.
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:104909:381"/> And in this Case the Good GOD, seeing the desolate circumstances of his Faithful Servants, and observing how wholly they devolve themselves upon him, will in a peculiar manner be present with them, and impart unto them these Reliefs and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, which he in his Wisdom knows to be necessary for them; And so, though to the eyes of the World they may seem to be poor, helpless and forelorn Creatures, yet there is a secret and invisible Hand, that powerfully upholds and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes them in all their desolations. Thus our Blessed Saviour when he tells his Discsples,<note n="*" place="margin">Jo. 16.82.</note> That <hi>they should be scattered every one to his own, and leave him alone;</hi> He lets them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that in this solitarie and destitute state of his, there was one that would stick closs to him, and never abandon him, that would attend him in all his Tribulations, effectually maintain him under them,
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:104909:381"/> and at last Gloriously deliver him from them. <hi>Ye shall leave me alone,</hi> saith he, <hi>and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</hi> This same will be the happy Priviledge of all his Faithful Followers. A Divine Presence will accompany them under all their destitutions, and will more than sufficiently recompence their cheerful dispensing with the Amities and Solaces of Creatures. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had Experience of it,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 4 16.17.</note>
                        <hi>All men forsook me</hi> saith he, <hi>but the LORD stood with me, and strengthned me.</hi> And besides the Friendships and Relations of the World do sometimes prove very great hindrances to advancing in Christian Perfection: The Deferences which they expect should be paid to them, and the Complyances that must be made with their Humours and Inclinations, do but too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ingage in the Omissions and Commissions of many things that do not so well consist with that strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:104909:382"/> and accuracie that our Holy Profession exacts from us. And therefore, if in this case, they should disregard or abandon us, we ought willingly to forego their Favours, and to rejoyce that our <hi>snares are</hi> in so far <hi>broken and we escaped.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet further, our dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer endured <hi>cruel mockings and derisions.</hi> Indeed contempt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach were his continual attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants all his Life; But towards the close of it, his ignominious treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were strangely heightned in degree, and increased in number. Then it was that the wit and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his wicked persecutors were set on work to contrive methods how to put the most exasperating affronts upon him, both by words and deeds; For having seized on his Sacred Person, they led him<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 26.57.</note> before his partial and blood thirsty Judges, giving him all alongs the treatments that were due only to a
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:104909:382"/> Criminal, where, when without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny regard to the Measures of Justice or Pleas of Innocence, they had sentenced him to dy, they set him up as the Object of their bitter scorn and contempt, and imployed their sacrilegious tongues and Hands to dishonour and ridicule him; For then<note n="*" place="margin">Mat: 26.67.63.</note>

                     <p>Behold here the Son of GOD not only despising Honours, but endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affronts! Soveraign Majesty not only not regarded, but derided and insulted over! The Adorable One saluted with mock homages, and he that was perfectly Innocent post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon'd to a notorious Malefactor! But why was it that our Redeemer hath so remarkably exemplified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, bearing contempt and disgrace? Why did the King of Glory suffer himself to be so vilified and affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Why did he degrade himself so low, as to become capable of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indignities put on him by poor worms of the Earth? Was it only that his Followers might look on, or perhaps admire and commend his Patience in these dishonourable ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters? Was it to procure them Exemption from the like treatments here on Earth, and leave them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:104909:384"/> to do, but quietly to reap the merits of his contempt and disgrace? Was it that they might more freely pursue the honours and glories of this World, desire to be regarded, and to have all the Marks of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect put upon them, and decline undergoing whatever is humbling and ignominious? or was it not rather to point out unto them, and to engage them in the certain way how they may attain to true Glory and Honour, and effectually partake in his Merits? Since the holy JESUS travelled to Heaven through disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and contempt, through scorn and derision, why should not all his Disciples be willing to become his Fellow Travellers? <hi>Let us go forth therefore,</hi> saith the Apostle,<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 12.13.</note>
                        <hi>unto him without the Camp bearing his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</hi> But alas! how apt are we to storm and swell, if a slight be put on us, how hardly can we get an affront digested? How fiercely do
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:104909:385"/> we resent our being made the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of scorn and mockerie! And yet we would be accounted the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the meek and patient and despised JESUS. How little do our dispositions savour of his Spirit? He bore the most pungent indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the greatest Composure, and a disdainful look will put us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together out of tune. Reproach and affronts were his continual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, and we make a strange buzle about a few undervaluing car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, which perhaps are but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to be such. He was debased below the vilest Criminals, and we cannot endure that any should come in competition with us, much less be preferred before us. But how unreasonable is this? He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served all Honour was eminently disgraced, and we who deserve all disgrace would be eminently Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. Why should not we, who have in us the root and source of
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:104909:385"/> all shame and dishonour, be content when we are vilified and set at naught? is there any thing done to us in being thus treated, but what we truly deserve? And why then should we murmure at it? It is a sign that we have not yet got Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient discoveries of the disorders and deformities of our Nature, or that we are nor duly affected with them, when we cannot endure to be held for what we are. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, contempt and derision, when patiently born, are excellent Means to check and quell our proud self-love, and if we were very desirous to grow in <hi>Humility,</hi> that most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary and fundamental Grace, we would cheerfully embrace whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath a tendency to root out and destroy the great enemy of it; <hi>That is,</hi> our pride and self-esteem. These doubtless will appear hard sayings, if not down-right folly, to our old man. However, all the sincere
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:104909:386"/> Followers of Jesus will with St. <hi>Paul</hi>

                     <p>In fine the Holy JESUS endured <hi>sharp and exquisit pains in his Body.</hi> In order to be informed of these in particular, we need but with a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attention peruse the history of his Passion, as it is recorded by the Holy <hi>Evangelists.</hi> There we shall learn, how every Member in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was put to grievous tortures.

                        <hi>I am pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out like Water,</hi> and by reason of the preternatural distention of his sacred Limbs upon the ignominious Tree, he uttered the following Words, <hi>All my Bones are out of joint.</hi> Nothing was forgot that might sharpen his Pains and increase his Anguish. The barbarity of enrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dogs, or the truculency of the most savage beasts, are but faint figures of the incompassionat spite of his persecutors. They would not abate a stroke, or lessen or mitigat any one instance of his punishments; And at last, to crown both his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily torments and their hideous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, they nailed him Hands and Feet

There are in all the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the Son of GOD, and particularly in his Inward Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, Peculiarities and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, that no other Sufferings can or should pretend to. The Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Person that suffered, did stamp an infinit Value on them, and the vastness, or rather immensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Love to GOD, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Man in Suffering gave such degrees of Sensibility to his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that nothing can reach or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, but a Love as boundless as his own. And the more that any measures of this Love take Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:104909:389"/> of the Heart, so proportionably the more Just and Clear will one's Apprehensions of the Sufferings of the Lamb of GOD be. But this sort of Meditations will fall in more seasonably under the other <hi>View</hi> I promised to give of them. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them at present only as they are Examplary. And in order to know them in this Respect, the best Methods will be to contemplat them in their Sources or Causes, whereof I shall mention but these three; 1. <hi>The sins of Men.</hi> 2. <hi>Their Miseries.</hi> 3. <hi>His own Spiritual desolations.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The sins of Men.</hi> How heavily did these ly on his Heart, and how often did they draw tears from his Eyes.

It pierc'd him with a deep sorrrow, to see that his Gracious and Charitable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to do them Good, were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ineffectual by their willful unbelief. How surpassing must that grief have been which attended these mournful Accents of his over the rebellious obstinacie of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. O Jerusalem</hi>

<pb n="673" facs="tcp:104909:390"/> knew, all Adoration, Respect, and Obedience were due, dishonoured and blasphemed, to see his Spirit resisted, his Offers slighted, and all the Methods of his Love and Grace disregarded? To be sure that Zeal which made him so warmly resent, the Indecencies that were committed<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 21.12.13.</note> by the <hi>Buyers</hi> and <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> because it was his <hi>Father's House,</hi> would much more oblige him to notice, with a mixture of grief and holy Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the more aggravated indignities that were done to him.</p>

                        <hi>he bore our sins in his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> yet the Evangelist assures us, that it received a Completion in his healing the Sick, and bearing their corporal infirmities, by an admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Compassion, which gave him
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:104909:392"/> so profound a Sense of the uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and incommodities of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Distempers, as if himself had been actually affected with them; And indeed it is hard to tell how great a length a sincere and simpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing Charity may go in feeling the Miseries of others. Dayly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience lets us see how farr even natural Affection carries us, as to communicating in the distresses of a dear Friend or Relation, how their pains and agonies, their groans and tears, do reproduce themselves in us, and transform us in a sort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fellow Patients with them. What shall we say then of the Noble and Undisguised, the vast and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive Charity of the Son of GOD?

                     <p>In fine we must nor foreget, That as our LORD, when he bewailed the sins of Men, laboured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Sinners, and in sympathiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their miseries, took care to remove such as were incumbent, and to prevent these that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, so also ought his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to do.

A third Source of his <hi>Inward Sufferings,</hi> were these <hi>Desolations</hi> that he endured in his Soul, and which consisted in a total suspension of the consolatorie Manifestations of the Divine presence, and in these most afflicting-sensations that are consequential to such a Suspension: O who can conceive the Anxieties that seized on his holy Soul, when GOD began to hide his Face from him, and ceased to impart these Joys which were his Life, and as it
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:104909:394"/> were, his <hi>Element.</hi> How desolate and melancholly must needs his state have been, when that amorous Presence that was wont to cherish and solace him had withdrawn it self.

                        <hi>My GOD, my GOD, why hast thou forsaken me.</hi> How it was then that the<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 69.1.</note>
                        <hi>Waters came in even into his Soul,</hi> and that by reason of these dismaying terrors that invaded him in this dark and gloomy Interval his * <hi>Heart became like wax, and was melted in the midst of his Bowels.</hi> Now it was that he suffered an amazing Ecclipse, and whereof that of the <hi>Sun</hi> at his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion was but a faint <hi>Emblem.</hi> A dismal Cloud interposed, which caused a sad night in his Soul, and filled his Cup with wormwood and gall. But then as GOD was ever near him, so though he withdrew
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:104909:395"/> from him the comforting Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Presence, yet he still sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him with a Secret and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Force, whereby he was not only kept from sinking under these vast loads of troubles, both outward and inward, that were on him, but also carried through them in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and Victorie.</p>
                     <p>Thus our Dear Redeemer would needs feel the miseries of a state of <hi>Spiritual Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Desertion,</hi> not only that he might have Experience of our Temptations &amp; Calamities, in order to be our Merciful and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing High Priest, not only that he might merit our being Re-admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Participation of Divine Consolations, by his having drunk so bitter a Cup for our sakes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that he might encourage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to drink our several shares of the same Potion, and travel with him in the paths of <hi>Internal Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> and <hi>Desolations,</hi> in order to be
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:104909:395"/> prepared and qualified for solid and permanent Joyes. When the two aspiring<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 20.20, 21, 22, 23.</note> Disciples presented a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our LORD, desiring <hi>to be admitted to sit, the one on his Left Hand, and the other on his Right, in his Kingdom.</hi> By the return which he made to them, he plainly enough intimates, that they sought after a Dignitie whereof they were not as yet capable; That they would have the Crown before their having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the conflict, or obtained the Victorie; That they behoved first <hi>to drink of his Cup, and be Baptised with his Baptism.</hi> That is, Suffer Outwardly and Inwardly as he did; That this Advancement was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred without respect of Persons, and that he could not give it. <hi>But to them for whom it was prepared of his Father,</hi> (so the Original Words ought to be translated) <hi>That is,</hi> to such as by patient bearing all sorts of Sufferings, and perseverance

And as our most dangerous enemies are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, or combat us internally, so must we in our Oppositions to them suffer internally. It is evident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that our Redeemer in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cup of Internal Sufferings, intended that his Followers should do the like, and as he endured the Suspension of Divine Consolations, so must they. The good GOD, doth for Great, and Wise and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Reasons, withdraw sensible Sweetnesses from his Children, when they are able to bear Tryals of that Nature. Indeed as long as they are but Babes, tender and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:104909:396"/> easily discouraged, and apt to return again to seek Solaces and Satisfactions in the Creatures; I say, while the case is thus with them, <hi>He feeds them with the Milk of his Consolations,</hi> and gives them Sweetnesses, and by these tastes of his Goodness; He lets them se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> that he can give them Delights in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly more satisfying, and more valuable than these which Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can bestow. And by these Means he keeps them in his Love: But then, when they are more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in Strength and Firmness, and become capable to endure the more <hi>Perfective Methods</hi> of his Grace, he lays on them the Crosses of <hi>Internal Desolations.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, these desolations are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the consequences of their own unwatchfulness and sinful miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages. But it is not alwayes so; For GOD, in his infinite Wisdom, sees it meet, even when they are
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:104909:397"/> very Faithful to him, to put this Cup in their hands, and by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gives them one of the greatest Instances of his Fatherly Love; Since thereby he designs to advance them to greater Measures of Purity and Perfection, to try their Love to him, and to resign it, to make it more Pure and Disinteressed, by crucifying the more Spiritual, and consequenly the more dangerous <hi>Self-Love,</hi> which would always be feed with <hi>Sweetnesses</hi> &amp; <hi>Delights,</hi> and cannot be Devout when it is treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the rougher entertainments. And moreover, by leaving them in this desolate state, to let them see their own emptiness and insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; How weak and barren Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they are in themselves, and how incompetent to be the causes of their own Happiness, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to prevent their being lifted up with pride and self-conceit, to make them more humble and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:104909:397"/> on Divine Influences, more fervent and more importunat in their Prayers, and more strictly watchful over their Hearts. And yet farther, to prepare and fit them for receiving in due time more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Measures of Divine Influences, as also to heighten and sublimate their Joyes, to make them the more Relishing as well as more Exuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant; For it is certain, that the more Humble and Pure, the more Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of themselves, and the more abandoned to GOD they are, the more abundantly will he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat himself unto them, and the deeper and more permanent their Desolations have been, the more exalted and savory will their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures be, <hi>When GOD shall restore to them the Joyes of his Salvation;</hi> For as when after a long and tedious and stormy Winter, in which the Sun hath scarce made any, or but very faint and inefficacious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:104909:398"/> that glorious Luminary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns with unclouded and reviving Light, we welcome him with vast Satisfactions, and even with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than though he had been our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Attendant in his most Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Circumstances. So when after a long and afflicting Winter of Spiritual Desolations, the Sun of Righteousness appears again; The wearied and languishing Soul receives him with fuller Joyes and larger Appetites, than thô he had uninterruptedly shone on it with his clearing and consolatorie Beams. And hence, that I may note this by the way, we may very probably satisfie our selves, why some will have greater Degrees of Glory in Heaven than others. For the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this may be▪ because some will have greater Capacities than others, and their Capacities will be greater, because their Desires will be more dilated and enlarged, and
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:104909:398"/> again, this greater Dilatation of their Desires may be in part caused by the greater Intenseness and longer continuance of their internal Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; For as the more drain'd and exhausted, whither by heavy Toil and Labour, or by long Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or otherwise, the natural moisture of ones Body is, the more violent is his thirst, and therefore the more capable he becomes of fuller Draughts of the quenching Liquor. A small quantity or a few mouthfuls of it will not do the turn in this case, such as might be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to allay the thirst, when it is but overly and superficial, so the more deeply inward Desolations and Sufferings do sink into, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrat the Soul, the more vehement and intense is the Desire, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the greater Capacities one hath to receive more full and more abundant Measures of the Divine Light and Joyes.</p>
                     <pb n="690" facs="tcp:104909:399"/>
                     <p>These and such like are the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Designs the Blessed GOD hath in dispensing a State of Internal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations unto his Children. But we are to remember, that even when he withdraws from them his Consolations, he still upholds and strengthens them by a Secret and Invisible Hand: He never aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons them as to the supporting and sanctifying Influences of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, <hi>When</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 43.2.</note>, <hi>thou passest through the waters I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they shall not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow thee.</hi> He not only prevents their being overwhelmed by them, and sinking under them, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he carries them through with great Profit and Advantage. They lose nothing but their impurities and distempers, so that thô to their own sense it seems as if GOD had foresaken them, yet it is not so; For in effect, he is still with them, and by means of this secret presence
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:104909:399"/> of his, which powerfully operats in them, they excellently improve in the most necessary and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable Graces.</p>
                     <p>Now, that a State of Spiritual Desolations is sometimes the Lot of the Saints, the holy Scripture, in which we have an account of their own Experience, doth put beyond doubt. We have pregnant Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of such a State as this very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten aforded us in the Royal Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist's Devotions, <hi>My Soul,</hi> saith he,<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 119.81.82.83.</note>
                        <hi>fainteth for thy Salvation, mine eyes faill for thy Word, saying, when wilt thou comfort me, for I am become like a bottle in the smoke.</hi> To the same purpose he frequently delivers himself else where. And therefore to imput all the different vicissitudes of Desolations and Joyes which the Saints Experience in the Progress of a Spiritual Life, to different turns of Fancie, or to the Changes or Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Blood and animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:104909:400"/> is to bewray a prodigious ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Methods of GOD's Conduct towards the Souls of Men. It is not however denyed, but many, such I mean, as either have drunk in false notions of Religion; or have adopted into their Creed principles; which, by reason of the direful Represent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tions they give of the Blessed GOD, and of his Designs upon his Creatures, are naturally calculated to torment Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Minds, and to fill them with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting scruples, or have been taught marks to judge of themselves by that are deceitful &amp; illusive; Or, in fine, who imagining that they are in a State of Grace, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites of Heaven thô truely they be <hi>alienated from the Life of GOD,</hi> will needs grasp at all the Comforts of Devotion, as of Right belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; Many I say, being in such circumstances as these, may labour under inward Anxieties, and
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:104909:400"/> be infested with doubts and scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. But then their troubles are not the result of that Spiritual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion we have been treating of, but the genuine Consequences of either their mistakes or wickedness. And the best way, I suppose, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve such will be, according as their different Cases shall require, either to correct their notions of Religion, or to give them Just Thoughts of GOD, and of his Gracious and Fatherly Designs on Mankind, or to direct them to the True and Undeceiving Measures of Sincerity. Or lastly, to convince them that the Comforts of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are not imparted to such as are Strangers to <hi>Self-denyal</hi> and <hi>Purity.</hi> Whereas, when Sincere and good Souls are found in a state of desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Course that ought to be taken with them, is, To recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to them, that they humbly and unrepiningly submitt to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:104909:401"/> whom they own to be Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly Wise and Good, that they be content to be disposed of as their Heavenly Father pleases; Knowing that all his Paths are<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 25.10.</note>

                     <p>Upon the whole we see, that our LORD hath all his Life long travelled in the Paths of Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Sufferings, both Outward and Inward, and that to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to him herein, is what all

Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as a devout Soul expresses it<note n="*" place="margin">Theol. de la Croix P. 78.</note> if a Patriarch or Prophet, if a Saint or an Angel had, out of Love to us,
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:104909:404"/> left us such an Example, it were unreasonable to despise and slight it; But now that the infinit Wisdom of GOD hath vouchsaf'd to become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnat, and appear among us in the dress of our mortality, that he, who was the infallible Truth, who neither can deceive, nor be deceived, hath himself come to be our <hi>Pattern,</hi> how much more ought we not to neglect it, but endeavour with all the care that is possible for us to conform to it exactly and in every Instance. His having gone before us in the Paths of Sufferings and Tribulations, is enough to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to us, and we may be confident, that as long as we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Steps, we shall neither lose our way, nor miss of that happie Place whither we are travelling. Certainly he knew the surest and the safest way to Bliss and Glory, and since he chose the Way of the Cross and Sufferings, we need not
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:104909:404"/> doubt but it is the high Way, nor fear to <hi>accompany him in it.</hi> But alas this way appears to us under a very frightful aspect, it looks as it were all beset with thorns: How loath are we to enter upon it! And if we make but a few paces in it, how soon do we wearie of it, and turn again into the Paths of Ease and Pleasure.</p>
                     <p>If no more were required of us with regard to the Sufferings of our Redeemer, but only to <hi>Meditat</hi> on them in our thoughts, as the great Instances of his Love, and the price of our Redemption, or to <hi>Believe</hi> that he hath done and suffered all for us, and to perswade our selves, that upon this <hi>Belief</hi> we are assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entituled to, and become imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly capable of, that Pardon, Grace, and Glory, which he hath purchased; This we might be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily induced to comply with.

                     <p>And accordingly, we find that his first Votaries, were very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous Images of him in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard.

                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1.</note> Be ye followers of me, even as I am of Christ. <hi>But if thou lovest the praises of Men, and would have Respect and Deferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces payed thee, if thou seekest Ease and Softness, and a Life of Pleasures, then know that thou art out of the Right Way. For it is necessary that thou be
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:104909:409"/> crucified with thy crucified Redeemer, and suffer with him who suffered for thee, in order to be Glorified with him. It being very just that the Bride should partake of the Calamities of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome, and so become a Fellow-sharer and Joynt-Heir with CHRIST, for it is not granted to any person to enter into the City of the Saints, and to rest and reign there with the King of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for ever without Sufferings, and without having passed through the rough and narrow way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But alas! These seem to us very hard sayings, and are such as we do not willingly entertain. We would have a Gospel that consisted only of Promises and Indulgences, that would make us Holy without needing to be Moral, and charm us into Heaven without puting us to any trouble. But a Gospel that lays Restraints upon our appetites, and obliges us to cross our own wills, and to crucify our <hi>old man</hi> by
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:104909:409"/> Penitence and patient Sufferings, hath, we think, too much of a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal strain in it.</p>
                     <p>We are very willing that the Merits of our Redeemer should be our's, but as to Suffering, we leave that entirely to Himself. Jesus, as the Devout <hi>A Kempis</hi> piously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, <q>hath now a days many Lovers of his Kingdom and Glory, but few that will be the Friends of his Cross. He hath many who desire his Consolations, but few that will share with him in his Troubles. He finds many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of his Table, but few of his Abstinence and Fasting. All will Rejoyce with him, but few will Suffer with him, and for him. Many will accompany him to the breaking of Bread, but when it comes to drinking of the Cup of his Passion, he hath then but a few Attendants. Many will reverence his Miracles, but few
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:104909:410"/> will so follow him in the Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of his Cross.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But why hath the Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fixed on the Way of Sufferings, as the Way to Eternal Life? Why should the Way to the Regions of Bliss and Glory be so difficult! Why was not a smooth and easie way pitched on? A way strawed all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs with Roses, entirely exempt from inconveniences, and that would not in the least incommod the Travellers? A way that would charm and invite all that heard of it to croud into it? Why should it now be a settled and irrevocable Stature, <hi>That we must</hi>

                        <hi>through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of GOD?</hi> The Reason of this to be sure, is not that the Blessed GOD hath any pleasure in the Sufferings of his Children and Servants, <hi>For</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Lam. 3.33.</note>
                        <hi>he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men.</hi> Neither must we imagine that it is an arbitrary
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:104909:410"/> Imposition, the appointment of one that wills because he wills, without regard to the Measures of Wisdom, Goodness, and Equity. The Will of GOD is ever in Conjunction with his other Perfections; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>all the Ways of the LORD are Right,</hi> as a<note n="*" place="margin">Hosea 14.9.</note> Prophet hath it, and though sometimes the Reasons of his Procedures and Injunctions are not obvious to our shallow minds, yet did he vouchsafe to acquaint us with them, he might appeal to our Consciences concerning the Wisdom and Justice and Goodness of them. Thus, when to satisfie the injurious murmurings of the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelits,</hi> he condescends, as he very often did, to account for his Ways,<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 18.25.33.20.</note> leaves it to their Ingenuity, if they had yet any remainders of it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in the Case. <hi>O house of</hi> Israel, <hi>are not my Wayes equal.</hi> And indeed though he should give us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but the simple and naked Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:104909:411"/> of his Will and our Duty, without discovering unto us the Reasons of them, yet we are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay that Deference and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to his Divine Perfections, as to trust our selves to his Conduct implicitly, resolving that it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly better for us to be under the Direction of his Holy, and Wise, and Good Will, than to be influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the counsels of our own will, which is blind. and corrupt, and byassed by a great many lusts, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and prejudices. But in effect, all the difficulties that we meet with in the way to Heaven, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely owing to our apostacie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from GOD, and to these perverse dispositions and habits. which our natures have contracted. GOD made not the way to Bliss <hi>Narrow</hi> and <hi>Uneasie,</hi> but that it is so now, is visibly the consequence of our degeneracie; For certainly all the difficulty that we find in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:104909:411"/> to Paradice, consists in running counter to our depraved inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in crossing our wills, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying our lusts, and subduing our passions, in breaking off all corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with our ghostly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the World, Devil, and Flesh, and generously resisting their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities and temptations. And in one word, since our Souls are in a sickly and languishing condition, in quietly submitting to the Methods of their Cure and Recovery, though the Applications should be uneasie, and the Potions bitter. Now it is very plain, that the Reason in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral why Injunctions of this sort are given us, is because our natures are lapsed, our inclinations become vitious, and all our faculties diseas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and out of order. For had we continued in the State of Innocence and Purity, nothing of all this had been exacted off us. And therefore, if in the performance of these dutys,
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:104909:412"/> which our lapsed state hath now rendred necessary and indispensable, we meet with difficulties, we must not complain of GOD, who gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciously prescribes to us the Methods of our Cure, and acquaints us with the Way to Happiness, but blame our own folly which hath involved us in such deplorable circumstances, as put us under a necessity of partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and suffering some Severities, in order to recover our Health and Happiness. If one should by his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full intemperance and excess spoil his Health, and contract a great many sad and fatal maladies and distempers, and such as could not be cured without using some search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines, or making uneasie and painful Applications, it were very unreasonable to murmure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Physician, because he suites his Medicines to the nature and circumstances of the Malady. The Patient ought rather to fall
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:104909:412"/> foul on his own extravagancies which have involved him in distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that cannot be cured at an easie rate. To be sure, in this case Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Prudence of the Physician deserve to be gratefully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and his Methods of Curing patiently submitted to, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if he so orders it, That by ministring some excellent Cordials, the Patient shall be enabled to go through with his Course of Physick and the smart and anguish which the Potions or Applications may cause so mitigated by <hi>Linitives</hi> that they shall be very tollerable as well as beneficial; This is the very case with lapsed Mankind, we have by our wilful Apostacie plung'd our selves into woeful circumstances, and a great many lamentable diseases have seized on us, and it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that our darknesses can be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed, our impurities cleansed, our vitious habits rooted out, our flesh
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:104909:413"/> and its lusts crucified, and our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>located Faculties set right again, without our being sensibly afflicted, and enduring pain and trouble. For the Blessed GOD treats us as free Creatures, and as it was by our own wills that we turned away from GOD, became corrupt and impure, and run our selves into sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and distempers, into ruine and perdition, so it is by these same Wills prevented, excited, and asist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Divine Grace. That we must return into the Right Way, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Methods of our own, and the Means of our Purification, and patiently suffer all the anguish and uneasiness that our fallen and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved state obliges us indispensably to undergo, in our return to a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Immortality, and withal grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully adore and acknowledge the Wisdom and Charity of our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Physician, who hath so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently adopted his Remedies to our
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:104909:413"/> maladies. And though softer and more easie Methods would be more agreeable to our Flesh, and Blood, yet, to be sure, they would not be so beneficial to our Souls, nor so certainly issue in our Happiness and Salvation; For if our distempers and impurities were so removed or rather charmed away, as that we should feel nothing that were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and afflicting: This would tempt, or even unite us to run into our former ruinous and destructive courses, whereby we should be plunged of new into a state of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, diseases and defilements. But when, on the other hand, our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers are cured, and our filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses done away by Methods which make us feel some smart and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, we become more cautious and watchful, and less apt <hi>to turn again to folly.</hi> And moreover, as by recovering our Health and Purity in a way of Suffering, a greater
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:104909:414"/> sense of our distempers and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is begot in us, we see more throughly into our miseries and wretchfulness, are more solidly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the necessity of Cure and Cleansing, and of our own utter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to effectuat either, so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we thereby become more humble, more sensible of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness, more diffident of our own strength, more dependent on Divine Grace, more fervent in our Prayers, and more grateful to the Author of our Deliverance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the softer methods of redressing our disorders, which our corrupt natures are so fond of, are destitute of all these advantages. But after all, there is no just Ground, why the Way of Suffering should be counted so very harsh and uneasie. For since now <hi>this way</hi> is recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and even made lovely to us by the Example of our Blessed Saviour, since it is sweetened by Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations,
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:104909:414"/> as the Sufferings of Christ, saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

                        <hi>abound in us, so our consolation aboundeth by Christ.</hi> Since all the troubles and difficulties that are rencountered in this way, are rendered easie and very tollerable, by the mighty Supports that are afforded such as travel in it; For, as St. <hi>Peter</hi>

<pb n="728" facs="tcp:104909:420"/> an assaulting adversary, as on the o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther it doth one that resist and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers. Now, the <hi>World</hi> sometimes accoasted him with its smiles and flatteries, dressed up it self in its most aluring circumstances, display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before him all its pomp and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, its Riches and Honours, its Ease and Pleasures, its Favour and Friendship, its Praises and Applause, recommended to him its Wisdom and Maxims and Customs, as very excellent and profitable. But he made no account of all these things, and would never be proselitted to become its Votorie by the most winning Addresses that it could make. And the method he took to baffle its impotrunities and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it. was by a <hi>Generous Contempt</hi> of all that was taking and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in it, and by puting a Value u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and even embracing the very contrary Circumstances. He trampl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all its Glories, and slighted

He prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Povertie to its Riches, Disgrace to its Honours, Pains and Sufferings to its Ease and Pleasures, Desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to its Comforts. Destitution to its Friendship, and Disrespect to its Praises. Folly to its Wisdom, and walked by Measures which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted its Maxims, and shamed and opposed its Customs. But then, when it could not prevail upon him by the Methods of Allurement and Smile, it assaulted him with its <hi>frowns,</hi> with what was <hi>frightful</hi> and <hi>dismaying</hi> to fraile <hi>Humanity,</hi> it load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with reproach and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, set him up as the Object of its contempt and derision, as the Butt of its malice, and as a Theater whereon to act its Tragical Scenes. But the <hi>World</hi>'s frowns prov'd as unsuccessful as its flatteries; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could oblige the Holy JESUS to enter into a Truce with it. He came of purpose to Conquer it, and
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:104909:421"/> would not quit the field until he had obtained a perfect Victorie. And the way by which he chose to combat its inhumanities, was <hi>by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the Cross, and despising the shame.</hi> He received all the attacques of its malice, with undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, bore them with incomparable Patience, and by meekly undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all instances of its fierceness and crueltie, he did defeat and frustrat its attempts, and gloriously triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Flesh,</hi> in fine, with its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, passions and inclinations, is an other enemie to our Happiness, and the most formidable and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, because near us, and in our very bosomes, and because by means of it our other enemies have access to us, and gain ground on us, and seduce us from our Duty and Alledgiance to our great Soveraign. This adversary also our Redeemer combated and overcame. But that
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:104909:421"/> we may comprehend this aright, let us consider that the Son of God out of his surpassing and ineffable Love to the Children of Men, would needs feel their miseries, and know their temptation, and that not only that from his own Experience of what it is to be tempted, what violence one suffers in being attac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued, and in resisting, what aversion the <hi>Flesh</hi> hath to what is uneasie, how weak it is, and what force is necessary to make effectual and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful Oppositions, he might have compassion on their infirmities, and minister proportionable Aids, but also that he might teach us by his own Example how we should treat our flesh and blood, and what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods we must take to subdue and conquer its inclinations and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, and that he might encourage us to enter the Lists with it in full hopes of obtaining by his Grace a certain Victory. And for this end,
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:104909:422"/> it pleased him to assume the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature in a state of Mortality, charged with Infirmities and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, exposed to Temptations, and having Passions and Inclinations like ours.</p>

That the Holy Scriptures give us this twofold view of his Death, is evident enough. <hi>First,</hi> It is a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,</hi> That is, The Holy JESUS having asserted and proclaim'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gospel, the glad tydings of. Salvation, to the World, did, by undergoing the bloody and painful Death of the Cross, give a very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Testimony unto, and eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirm the Truth of these Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Doctrines, which he had been preaching all his Life, it is the part of a True Prophet, not only to endure hardships and persecutions, in behalf of the Doctrines which he delivers in the Name of, and by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from GOD, but also to lay down his Life for it, when his so doing can serve as a Mean to assure
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:104909:432"/> and convince of the truth of it, and recommend it. And if he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline ot shift doing this, when visib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called to it, it would beget a just suspsiion in the minds of Men, of the falshood of his doctrine, and make them question these pretences to a Divine Mission. A Seducer will not willingly dy for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of that Doctrine which he knows to be false, for it is not the Salvation of Souls that Men of this stamp labour for, but their own gain and advantage. Hence they are called<note n="*" place="margin">Matth: 7.15.</note>

<pb n="759" facs="tcp:104909:437"/> dearest Brethren, before I have the happiness to see you, as I hope I shall very shortly, being already on my way, take this occasion to write to you, that I may let you know the Dispositions in which I find my self, and the last request I have to make to you. For as I passed through diverce place, I have remarked such an excess of sorrow among the Faithful, who have heard of my being sentenced to death, that I have already judged by their carriage, what I may expect to see among you. But suffer me to tell you, that I dread your charity, and that I suspect it may do me a prejudice, thinking to procure me a Favour. wherefore I conjure you, not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by your prayers an Order of GOD, which is so advantageous to me, and without the execution whereof I cannot enjoy GOD so soon as I desire, have not, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:104909:438"/> you, too carnal a love for my body; But endeavour rather that it become the Sacrifice of GOD. Remember that you never envyed the Happiness of any Body, and that you your selves have taught others the way of Sufferings. If you will offer to GOD your Prayers for me, then let your Design be to beseech him that he would give me Force and power, that I may suffer as a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and not as one who is only nominallie such. I regard no more any thing on Earth: I am taken up with nothing but with Heaven; The World is already at an end as to me: Eternity fills me alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. I have signified to other Churches that I would dye wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie, providing you do not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose your selves to it. For I confess to you that I fear alwayes least the Love, which you bear to me, do something that will be unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:104909:438"/> and prove uneasie to me. Suffer for GOD's Sake, that the beasts devour me. I am the Corn of GOD, and their Teeth shall be as it were the Mill-stones, which shall grind me, to the end I may become the pure Bread of Jesus Christ. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther treat these Beasts so as they may become my Tomb, and leave nothing of my Body. I shall then become truely the Disciple of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, when the World shall see no more of one. Offer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your humble Prayers to God, that this Body which I carrie to the Lyons, may become a pure and spotless Oblation. I learn in my chains to desire nothing on Earth. From <hi>Syria</hi> even unto <hi>Rome,</hi> I combat day and night with Beasts, being tyed to ten <hi>Leopards,</hi> so I call the Souldiers which keep me in chains. And who, the more kind I am to them,
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:104909:439"/> do me the greater hurt, and wax the more ill natured and fierce, I am daily more and more edified by the injuries wherewith they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict me, yet I am not justified hereby. O that I were once eaten by the Lyons, which are prepared for me. I beseech GOD to make them eager to devour me. I shall kindly invite and allure them to set on me, and if they refuse to do it, and treat me, as they have done other Martyrs, whom they durst not approach nor touch, I shall ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate and provoke them to make the Attaque. I conjure you once more, my dearest Brethren, that you do not detain me any longer on Earth by your Prayers. Do not labour to keep me at a distance from GOD, by the love which you have for a corriptible body. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, my dear Children, that I speak to you after this manner.</q> For I know what is better for me: <q>It is
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:104909:439"/> now that I begin to be the Disciple of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> I desire no more any of these things that are on Earth: I breath only after <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Let the Fire seize on me, let the Cross torment me, let my bones be dislocat and drawn assun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, all my Members torn to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and my whole body grund to powder, In fine, let all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments invented by the Devil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal me, providing I may enjoy <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> O thou pure and Eternall light, whereof now I have some Glimpses, would even my friends contribut to separat me from thee, would they hinder me from going to thee and to thy jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable Glory by that same way through which my Master hath gone! Would you hinder me, my dear brethren, from becoming his follower! If you have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion for me, it is not in saving my Body, That it ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:104909:440"/> but rather in not opposing your selves to that violent desire which you see, I have after my GOD I say no more unto you, but only that I desire to die! <hi>My love is crucified.</hi> I feel a vehement fire within me which consumes me, And cries unto me. <hi>Come to your Father.</hi> I will not live any longer here below, I intreat that your selves may no longer will that I should, and pray unto GOD, I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly beseech you, that he may will it neither. Do not love me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to flesh and blood. As you see that what I write unto You, is <hi>not according to Flesh and Blood,</hi> I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace you all. I recommend my Church unto your Prayers, passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately requesting you to interceed with <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that he would Vouschafe to be a Pastor to it.</q> Behold here a Specimen of the Zeal, Devotion and Charity of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Martyrs! O how faint and languid are these little dying sparks
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:104909:440"/> of Love that are in our bosomes. in comparison of these ardent &amp; <hi>vic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>torious flames</hi> that bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the mean time it will not be improper to Caution here, that thô the occasions of suffering Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were very frequent, yet we should take care that we do not rashly and precipitantly rush upon it. We ought to be <hi>wise as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> and use all pious and prudent Methods, to secure our Lives as long as we can with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, imploying them in doing all the Good that is possible for us in our several Stations and Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, being still resigned to the good Pleasure of GOD, and content to be disposed of as he in his infinit Wisdom shall think fit, and in a constant readiness to lay down our Lives when we can no longer keep them and our Innocence too; <hi>That is,</hi> When the Honour and Interests of our Redeemer and his Religion
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:104909:441"/> visibly call for our so doing, and we plainly see that it is his will we should live no longer, having by the Conduct of his wise and good Providence, led us as it were by the hand to receive the Crown of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom. Thus the Holy JESUS prudently evaded the frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances of his enemies to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Life, till <hi>His hour was come,</hi> and then he willingly laid it down.</p>
                     <p>We must moreover beware that we do not unhappily mistake the Interests and Opinions, the little practices and prejudices of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Factions, and Parties, for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines. It is sad to consider how dark and doubtful, and even very false speculations, some external practices and Forms, yea the down right inventions of Men, have, by being Baptiz'd with Sacred Names, imposed on the World, have been
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:104909:441"/> cryed up and contended for with no less Zeal and Fervour, than if they had been the very essential Truths and Duties of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it is sadder yet to see vast numbers prodigally sporting away their Lives for the sake of these triffles, and imagining that they are as much the Favorits of Heaven for so doing as the Primitive Martyrs were. And hence each Sect hath its Martyrologies or list of Martyrs. and the great thing they are noted and commended for, is their Zeal and Constancie in confessing and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Death, not for the Gospel, but for the Opinions and Practices which distinguish the own partie, after which these fancies are confi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dently obtruded by the bigot Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as the Truths and Cause of GOD, now sealed with the Blood of the Saints. However, it is not to be doubted, but, when it so falls out that any truely Upright and
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:104909:442"/> Humble, Well-meaning and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, thô mistaken Souls, lose their Lives in such Cases, the good GOD, who looks into the Heart, and sees their sincere Intentions to please him, will pardon their mistakes, and recompense their Honestie and Integritie, but then the cause for which they suffer he disproves, and it will not come into consideration when he distributs his Rewards. We should carefullie labour to be rightly inform'd of the Nature and Designs of the Christian Religion, and to know the great Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of it; This would prevent our being imposed on by Specious Names, &amp; enable us to discern what <hi>doctrines</hi> are Valueable, &amp; worth our Zeal and our Lives; For these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious Martyrdoms we are now speaking of, are all owing to false Notions of Religion, and laying stress on airie and useless Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and external Circumstances,
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:104909:442"/> which ignorant, byassed &amp; factious <hi>Teachers</hi> have propagated among the unwarie &amp; credulous Multitude as Great and Sacred Things.</p>
                     <p>In fine, if we be called to lay down our lives for our holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we must take care to do it in the Spirit of <hi>Jesus,</hi> that is, we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ould discover in our Sufferings these lovely Graces, that sweet and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign Temper, that he did in his. That Resignation to the Divine Will, that Humility and Meekness, that Charity and Compassion, that Patience and Constancie which he did so conspicuously exemplifie to us on the Cross, we should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour piously to transcribe, when we are in the like Circumstances; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of spite and bitterness, of harshness and ill nature, no stormie Passions, or proud resentments, or fierce revenge should appear in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our words or carriages. This
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:104909:443"/> is it that wil beautifie our sufferings, give Lustre and Glory to our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, recommend our Religion, honour our LORD and Master, and reclaim our persecutors. It is in such a Juncture as this that we should frequently review our Divine Pattern, <hi>Look unto Jesus, and</hi>

A Martyrdom that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone without such a Frame and Disposition as this, deserves not
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:104909:443"/> that Name. If in pretending to lay down our Lives for our Redeemer and his Cause, we bewray a Spirit and Temper, quite Opposite to His, if Spit and Malice, Furious and Revengefull Passions, and Self-Conceit, Fretting and <hi>Chaig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> are in our Hearts, and Visibly discover themselves in our Words and Carriages, we dishonour Him, and bring a Reproach on the Cause for which we suffer, and we but falsly Arrogat to our selves, the Title of a Martyre. For a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre truely is one that in laying down his Life, Witnesses not only to the Truth of the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion, but also to the Spirit of it. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> assures us<note n="(d)" place="margin">1. Cor: 13 3.</note> That tho' <hi>One give his Body to be Burned,</hi> deliver himself to the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Death, for the sake of Religion, and <hi>have not Charity,</hi> which is the Spirit of it, his doing so, <hi>shall Profite him nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="772" facs="tcp:104909:444"/>
                     <p>But that I may lay down the Grounds of a daily conformitie to the Death of our Saviour, in that view of it which we have how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, it will be seasonable here, to take nottice of two sorts of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, and consequently of a twofold Martyredom. The first I shall call the Martyres of <hi>Persecution,</hi> by which I understand such as are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted for the sake of Truth and Righteousness, and who lose either their Lives, or their Honour and good Name, or their Riches and Possessions, or their Peace and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, any or all of these, because they will be Faithful to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and will chuse Rather to suffer all the Losses and Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that can be incur'd in this World, than abandon, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of either the Truths and Practices of the Christian Religion. Tho commonlie speaking these on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly are called Martyres, who lose
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:104909:444"/> their Lives for Christs sake and the Gospel, yet certainly they who u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that same account Forfeit any thing that is verie dear to Flesh and Blood, and which Men value at the same Rate they do their Lives, and perhaps more, may very justly be so Designed. Again, tho' witnessing to the Truth of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> be ordinary Reputed the Cause which makes a Martyre, yet I do not see, why Living according to the Divine Maximes of it, ought not to be Reckoned so too. And therefore, if any upon the account of their strict conforming their Hearts and Lives to these blessed Rules, which are so opposite to the Spirit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, the maximes and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the prophan and carnal world, should suffer obloquy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, contempt, and disgrace, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision, and scorn, and behoofed as Madmen and Fools, and they in the mean time bear all, this patiently,
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:104909:445"/> and are not prevail'd with to quit their Holy practises, it is certain that they may be verie deservedly num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered among the Martyrs, for they witness unto the Spirit, power and practise of the Chrstian Religion as others do unto the truth of it, and suffer for so doing.</p>
                     <p>The second sort I call Martyrs of <hi>Love and mortification.</hi> And by these I mean all who, tho' they be not persecuted by men, nor meet with harsh and cruell Treatments in this world, yet do for the Love of GOD, and from a vehement desire of becoming agreeable to him, renounce and foresake the world and its convenicies, Mortifie their lusts and passions, crucifie their Flesh and old man, generously deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves whatever corrupt nature inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatly craves, and welcome with humble patience and Unrepining Submission all the calamities that befall them as coming from the hands
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:104909:445"/> of GOD. Whosoever lives thus in constantly Contradicting his dearest and most rooted inclinations under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes a continual Martyrdom. What more painful Martyrdom, saith St. <hi>Bernard,</hi>
                        <q>than to endure hunger,<note place="margin">Quod Martyrium gravius est, quam inter epulas esu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rire, inter vestes mul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And therefore as many mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Lusts, so many Martyrdoms, and as many Acts of self denyal, so many dying Agonies. The pains and Torments of these Martyrs who loss only their Mortal Lives are
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:104909:446"/> quickly at an end, whereas the strugles and Death pangs of the Martyrs of Love may be lengthened for a Tract of many years. But since this in effect coincides with what I am to insist on under the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing head, I shall.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Death of our Redeemer as a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and that it was so, we need not Laboriously Evince, since the Holy Scriptures do so Copiously and so evidently attest it. That one passage of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> may be sufficient to assure us of it. <hi>He hath give himself for us,</hi>

                     <p>First I say, that it is <hi>Meritorious,</hi> or the procuring Cause of all good
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:104909:446"/> things, and its <hi>Meritoriousness</hi> is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially founded in the Divinity of the Person who offered it, and who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is himself the Victime, Worth and Merit, value and excellency, in the most soveraign degree, are inseparable from whatever this ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable person does or suffers. This Blessed Sacrifice is a source of all good things, because the source of all good things is united to it. The<note n="(x)" place="margin">Oecon: Divin: Tom: <hi>4:</hi> p: <hi>418.</hi>
                        </note> Divine and Eternal Spirit, or the Deity it self, the Deliverer, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, his Intercession, his infinit Dignity, an exact and perfect satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to, and fulfilling of all that a Mediator ought to do in order to procure Salvation for us, a mighty force, and all sorts of Divine Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and consequently, it is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Divine, and eternal Sacrifice, a Sacrifice that Merits infinitly, that Delivers, Saves, Fortifies, a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that is satisfactorie and Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and diffuses all good things,
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:104909:447"/> and all sorts of vertues in the Souls of such as aspire after conformity to it. And hence in holy Scripture Pardon, Grace, Reconciliation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Purification, Glorie and Eternal Life are Attributed to it as the meritorious and procuring cause. And indeed nothing is of greater force to prevail with GOD to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his Graces in us, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his treating us as out sins have deserved than to offer to him that Divine Sacrifice which was made in the Person of his Son Jesus Christ. And therefore in all our addresses to our Heavenly Father we should have a continual regard to it, and carry it alongs with us as that which will give vertue and Efficacy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptableness to our Prayers, perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves that what we seek from him in good earnest for the sake of this great Sacrifice of <hi>Love</hi> will not be denyed us. But the full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of this lovely Theme is, as
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:104909:447"/> hath been intimated once and again, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Secondly, I affirm that the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which Jesus Christ made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in dying for us is <hi>Exemplary,</hi> and consequently design'd for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he Sacrificed himself, that he might oblige us to do the like.

Whence it appears that the Life of a sincere Christian, is not a Life of Pompe and Splendour, of carnal case and Recreation; It is, as we have said, a time of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. And what doth Sacrificing
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:104909:449"/> import, but Binding, Killing, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, Sheding of Blood, Separ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the Filth, Burning? These things in the Spiritual meaning of them, and as they are figures of the Treatments which must be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the Old Man, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure its Death, are Exercises not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie pleasing and Gratefull to our Flesh and Self-love: And hence have proceeded all these soft and Flesh pleasing Representations and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements that have been made of the Sacrifice and Death of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, whereby the true Medicine of our Souls is converted unto poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and that which was Graciously designed for the Destruction of the works of the <hi>Devil,</hi> becomes a Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Sanctuarie unto them. Our Old Man would be excused from suffering and Dying, and to tell the Flesh that it must become a victime in conformitie to the Sacrifice of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, is a very hard saying,
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:104909:449"/> this is what it endeavours, by all means to shift and decline, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it pushes Men to lay down such easie and indulgent Schemes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this blessed Sacrifice, as may verie well consist with the Life and Gratification of all its Corrupt Lusts and Inclinations. It will have the Sacrifice of the Lamb of <hi>God,</hi> to be so in its Room and stead, as that it is Discharged for ever, from suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing in order to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Body of Sin, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trairie to the Tenour of the whole Scripture, and to the Sense and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and desires of the Saints, who have all, with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> aspired after nothing with greater Ardency, Than <hi>to know the Fellowship of his sufferings, and to be conformed into his Death,</hi> and who, each of them from his own Experience, could say as that Apostle<note n="(a)" place="margin">Gal: 2 20.</note>

The Flesh will be well pleased, that Christ be Sacrificed without it, providing this Sacrifice of his, be not inwardly Ratified and fulfilled in turning it together with its Lusts and Affections into a Victime.</p>
                     <p>Oh! Let us turn away our Ears from these pernicious insinuations of the Flesh! let us seriously Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that tho' our Redeemer paid a ransome for our Souls, yet he paid none for our Old Man, and that that very Sacrifice which was intended for the Rademption of our Souls, was intended also for the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Flesh. Oh, let us not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Blood of the Lamb of GOD by improving, or rather by Misimproving it unto Apologies and excuses for our Lusts, or into pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to secure the Life and interests of the Flesh. Let us view his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:104909:450"/> as a <hi>Pattern,</hi> and not as a <hi>Discharge</hi> from our indispensable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to Sacrifice our <hi>Old Man;</hi> For if we consider the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, as fulfilled and accomplished in himself, and stop at this Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of it, perswading our selves that by looking on it, and believing it Historicallie, as a thing without us, and done in our stead, we shall Reap its blessed Fruits, tho' we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endeavour to conform to it, nor admit its Sacred Efficacies into our Souls, in order to procure the Death of our Corruptions, we abuse the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, yet worse than the Jewes did the Sacrifices of Beasts; For they did partake of this sort of Sacrifices, according to all the etxent of reality, that was in a purely Material and Bodily Victime, they were Corporally besprinkled with the Blood, were Corporally purified, and did even partake Corporally in the Meat of the Altar; Whereas we,

                        </note> one verie pertinently remarks, since there are qualities in the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, where
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:104909:451"/> whereof some are Communicable, and others are not, we must beware that the Flesh do no take Sanctuarie here, and excuse it self from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation to imitat this Sacrifice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence, that some of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of it, are not within its reach. It is Necessarie therefore to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish with Respect to us, things which however continue in <hi>JESUS CHRIST.</hi> And to observe, that some of them are in Jesus Christ <hi>only,</hi> and that others are so in him, as to be <hi>Patterns</hi> and <hi>Copies</hi> to us, and which it is our duty to imitat and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe. For instance, there is in the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, an Infinit Merit, there are also in it pains, Agonies and Death; For <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath Merited infinitly, in that he hath sacrificed himself. Now it is incontestable, that Man cannot do the first of these two things, I mean, that he cannot merit, and much less merit infinitly. This the Flesh will
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:104909:452"/> be ready to catch at, and to conclude from it, that since the Sacrifice of <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> is infinitly merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; therefore it is not imitable, or if we pretend to imitat it, then the Sacrifice which we make of our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves must be meritorious, as His is. But if we do not wilfully shut our eyes in favours of our flesh, and blindly credit its absurd Reasonings, we may easily comprehend that there is a vast difference between meriting and sacrificing, although these two things are united in JESUS CHRIST. Merit is before the Sacrifice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of it: <hi>Infinit Merit</hi> was and might eternally have been in JESUS CHRIST without Sacrifice. It is an Original Quality, and essential to His Divine Person. But Sacrifice hath its source in the Sinner: It is originally, and in the first place ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of the sinner alone. It is not essentially <hi>meritorious,</hi> but only <hi>destructive</hi> of evil, and recompensed
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:104909:452"/> by the pure Good-will of GOD; but the Great, the Divine, the infinite and Pure Love, by which JESUS CHRIST charged himself with our Sacrifice, hath rendered it meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Him, and by it hath obtain'd all good things from GOD for us. It is plain then, that tho the Flesh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not merit, yet it may become a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, that is, dye and expire on the Cross of Self-denyal, Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Sufferings through the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Efficacies of the Sacrifice of the Son of GOD, which shall be communicated unto all who heartily engage in the Imitation of it.</p>
                     <p>Once more let us not suffer our selves to be imposed on by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and deceits of the Flesh; but call to mind rather. that, if we are sincerely the Disciples of JESUS, we are become a<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 2.8.</note>

But to the end this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice may be accomplished in us, we must address our Great and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful High-Priest,</hi> beseeching Him to impart unto us his Spirit of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Mortification; for as He through the Eternal Spirit <hi>offered up Himself unto GOD,</hi> so it is through the same <hi>Spirit, that we must mortifie the Deeds of the Body.</hi>

                           <hi>Rom:</hi> 8.13.</note> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, for this same end, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutly undergo Tribulations and Sufferings, bear Uneasinesses patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and meekly, and willingly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise penitential Severities; For as Pains and Agonies, Piercings and Bloodshed, and cruel Treatments, were the Fore-runners and Causes of the death of JESUS CHRIST, so also Troubles and Anguish, Calamities and Distress, pious Violences done to, and Contradictions of our corrupt Inclinations and Habites, are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:104909:453"/> unto the death of the Old-man. It is <hi>by knowing the fellowship of the Sufferings</hi> of our Redeemer, that we come to be made conformable <hi>unto his Death,</hi> and represent his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. It is by the Methods of the Cross, that is, by Sufferings and Self-denyal, that the Flesh and its Lusts are <hi>Crucified,</hi> and do expire, and therefore as long as we walk in the ways of Ease and Selfness, and continually cherish and gratifie our Earthly and carnal Appetites, it is not possible that our Old-man can become a Victime. Every Act of Self-denyal, every instance of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, every affliction that is undergone with patience, and humble Resignation to the Divine Will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as indeed as they are ever accompanied with the secret Force and Vertue of the Crucified JESUS, are as so many Strokes given to the Sacrifice tending to procure its death, and the last Stroke that it gets, is the
<pb n="792" facs="tcp:104909:454"/> death of the Body, but it is GOD himself, and not we, that must give this blow. Furthermore, as a vast and infinitly ardent Love, was the Fire in which our Lord offered up himself unto GOD as a sweet smell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice, so it is by the mighty Force and Operations of that same generous and Noble Principle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from him to us, that our Old-man is offered up, and consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; For when once this Heavenly Fire is kindled in our Bosoms, it will, if we do not stiffle and quench it, burn up all that is corrupt and vitious in us, it will prompt us to desire, and enable us to endure with joy and Satisfaction all the pains and tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bulations that are necessary for consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that Sacrifice, which we are obliged to offer in Imitation of that of our Redeemer. Hence proceed these vehement Aspirations, which all the devour Followers of the Lamb have after the Cross. <hi>O sacred way,</hi>

The Love of JESUS is of a singular Efficacie and Force, and when it hath got entrance into the heart, and is entertained there, it

                        </note> and will both explain and evince the necessity of what we are asserting. <q>There are, sayeth he, two things in Man, the one is his Soul, created by GOD for eternal life. The other is, <hi>his self-love, or his Corruption</hi> introduced into him by the Devil, and Sin for death eternal. And these two things are since the fall united in all Men. Now God doth present inseparably two other things to these, two which in this state of degeneracie are in every man. To the Soul of Man, which himself created, he Presents grace and life, and to his corruption, or carnal selflove, which came from the Devil, he presents the cross, death and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. And it is impossible to change the order and Relation of these things, that is, to present grace and life to our Old Man,
<pb n="798" facs="tcp:104909:457"/> and Corruption, to our flesh and self-love; and to present death to the Soul it self, which was created and design'd for, and made capable of life eternal, so also it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Embrace or partake in one of these, this without the other; to have life and grace without the Cross and death, for as much as the one introduces into the other, It being plain that Grace and true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue cannot live and prosper in the Soul, till what is evil and vitious in it dye and be done away; neither can Light appear in its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and brightness within us, unless all hinderances be removed, and our darkness and Impurities dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss'd. And thus Grace is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally presented to every Soul, on Condition that with regard to that Corruption which is now united to it, it Embrace Death and the Cross in order to be rid of it, and that it Resign unto God all its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:104909:457"/> and its Liberty, to the end, he may produce and Manifest, in it his Divine Life and all the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of his most holy Grace, in such a way as he shall Judge most Expedient.</q> It is now, I think abundantly Evident, That that Death and Crucifixion, to which we are obliged, in Imitation of the Death and Sacrifice of our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not an Arbitrary, but a very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Requisition. It is what we must indispensibly undergo in order to partake in the Fruits and purchase of his Meritorious Oblation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self on the Cross.</p>
                     <p>Whatever other Methods Men have invented in Order to attain to pardon and Eternal Life, if they be such as can consist with the Life of the Flesh, and do not require the Death and extermination of the old Man, they are certainly false and deceitful. That easie and Flattering Divinity, which gratifies our Self-love,
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:104909:458"/> and corruption owes its original to that woful place, whether it infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly leads, and it directly contradicts the Designs of our Saviours coming into the World, who as<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 5:</note> St. John <hi>tells us was Manifested to take away our sins,</hi> not the <hi>guilt of them only,</hi> but also their Filthinesses, their Life and Root, their Dominion and power, and that by obliging us to put off the body<note n="(b)" place="margin">Job: 11 20.</note> of the sins of the <hi>Flesh by that eternal and Spritual Circumcision,</hi> which his power and grace effectuats in us, in the exercise of Mortification and Self-denyal, &amp; all this to prepare &amp; fit us for Communion with him, &amp; to make us capable of the good things which he hath merited for us; for how can he pardon us, so as to receive us into his especial favour, and treat us as his peculiar Freinds? while <hi>we</hi> (a) <hi>are enemies to him in our minds,</hi> That is, while our hearts are habitually averted from him; while our inward Dispositions are unsuitable to, and at

Then the seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glories that dazled us, will be at the point of disappearing for ever, and the things that were wont to Gratifie us very highly, can yeild us no more Satisfaction. Then our Eyes will begin to be opened, and our thoughts of things will strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alter. Then our Circumstances will convince us of former mistakes, and we will be forced to Correct our false Judgements. Oh! that we would reason now, as we will be obliged to do then, and practise now what then we cannot, and so prevent these Direful, and Inexpressible Regrates, which the review of Mis-improving great Advantages and Opportunities
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:104909:460"/> of preparing for Eternity, will Creat in our Bosomes. Since then, not an Angel nor Glorified Spirit, but the Son of GOD, came from Heaven, out of Love to poor bewildred Mankind, to give them an <hi>Example,</hi> and thereby to acquaint them with the way by which they must return into Paradice again, and came, not in a dress of Glory and Majestie, But, that his Example might be Accommodat to their state and Capacities, cloath'd in Frail and Mortal Flesh. Oh! let us heartily endeavour to imitat and Transcribe it, and use all the Art and Skil in our Power, to engage others to do the like, and more especially our Children, whose Spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, both Nature and Religion, obliges us more narrowly to look after. It is a common and very just remarque, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> we are more readily brought over to out duty by <hi>Example</hi> rather than by <hi>Precept.</hi> Behold here an <hi>Example,</hi> that hath a great many singularities and Endearments in it;
<pb n="806" facs="tcp:104909:461"/> The Excellencie of the <hi>Person that</hi> gave it, the great Love that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in giving it, the Eminent and lovely Graces and vertues that are the Ingredients of it, and which it sets before us, the mightie Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and Force that attends it, and the blessed state to which the sincere imitation of it infallibly leads, are so many powerful Arguments to enforce conforming to it. O! let it be much in our thoughts, let us frequently review it, and continue so doing, till we be enamoured of its beauties. Let us establish it as the unerring Standard of our Hearts and Lives, and labour by all means to become agreeable to it in every instance. And when by the influences and Power of that Divine Grace, which ever accompanies the cordial imitation of this Blessed Example, we are in some measure growen up into it, and become as it were the Living Images of the Life and Death of our Redeemer, then it is that we
<pb n="807" facs="tcp:104909:461"/> are Qualified to speak of it, and Recomend it with Success, even our Conversations, being then Fragrant and Savory, will have a winning Eloquence, and force in them, and bespeak and invite all under our care and inspection, to aspire after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to this Amiable Pattern in a sort of Language, much more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive than the most Artificial strains of Rhetorick.</p>
                     <p>I intended in the nixt place,<note place="margin">The CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SION.</note> to have Evinced, that the <hi>Holy Jesus</hi> is our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, in his <hi>Resurrection</hi> &amp; <hi>Ascension,</hi> &amp; declared, the best way, I could, how we are to be made, conform to both, to the former, <hi>in our being raised up by the Power of it, into a new and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life.</hi> And to the other, in <hi>the Flights and Sallyes of our Souls towards Heaven,</hi> And, as it were, taking up our dwellings there, by our thoughts and Meditations, desires and Aimes, in a disregard, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness of this vain and Sinfull
<pb n="808" facs="tcp:104909:462"/> World. But Providence hath so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, that I am oblidged to stop here, which perhaps may be a Call both to the Writer and Readers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceed further to study well the Life and Death of our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to endeavour by his Grace to Transcribe, as exactly as is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for us, the Copies which he hath cast us, and by so doing, we will be the better prepared to enter on the Contemplation of that Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical and Heavenly Life, which we are to lead in conformity to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and Ascension. Yea, though we have not the Theorie and Speculation of it, yet by knowing the Fellowship of our Lords suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>and by being made conformable to his Death,</hi> we shall soon, <hi>know the Power of his Resurrection,</hi> and feel a new and Divine Life, springing up within us; For proportionably as the Old Man decayes and Dyes, the New <hi>Man Revives,</hi> &amp; gathers <hi>strength,</hi>
                        <pb n="809" facs="tcp:104909:462"/> as the Flesh is mortified, CHRIST begins to be <hi>formed in the Heart.</hi> And thus we should come to know, this Excellent Life, by a Living Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and Experience, and by a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Possession of the Reality and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it, and the knowledge which is attained this way, infinitly excels that which is got in the Barren and dry way of Reasoning and Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                     <p>The instances hitherto given of that Admirable Pattern, which our Lord hath set before us in his Life and Death, contain the great and principal strokes of it. I have insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them at greater length, because, though they be of vast Moment and Consequence, as hath been, I hope, sufficiently Evinced, yet they are generally but very little Reguarded, if not wholly neglected by the most. However it was not my intention to have stopt here, but to have descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Minuter, and more particular
<pb n="900" facs="tcp:104909:463"/> consideration of other things, and to have Represented. 1. The Graces which the holy JESUS did Exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in his Child hood, and younger years, intended more especially as a Pattern to the Youth. 2. These which be Exemplified in his <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> and more advanced Age, as a Pattern to the Adult. 3. These which he Exemplified towards the close of His Days, in the view of approaching Death, as a Pattern to such as are Old and stricken in years, directing them how to manage their more immediat Preparations, for Death and Eternity. 4. These which he Exemplified in his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as a Pattern to such as suffer with him, and for him, Teaching them how to behave under a Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, or otherwayes afflicted state. 5. His carriage when a dying, and what he Exemplified in that Juncture, as a Pattern to all his followers, when in the same case and Circumstances,
<pb n="811" facs="tcp:104909:463"/> according to which they ought to order and finish happily, the last Scene of their Lives. The discussing of these particulars, would make it fully appear, that the Exemple of our Redeemer, is a Compleat and perfect Pattern, exactly correspond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all the different states and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of our Life, and instructing us how to carry acceptably in each of them.</p>
                     <p>A third particular I proposed to be treated off under this Head, was to declare <hi>the Necessity, both of His giving us an Example, and of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to it,</hi> which though it be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evident from what we have been hitherto Representing, yet it might be very advantageously, and at great length insisted on. Here also I was resolved to obviat some Cavils of Prophane Wits, or soft and lazie Christians, and particularly that which would insinuat that at the Rate we have stated things, the Life
<pb n="812" facs="tcp:104909:464"/> of a Christian, must be very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and Pensive, wholly made up of bitter Egredients, and deprived of all pleasure and Solace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that the whole is Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated rather to Frighten from, than Engadge and Invite to the Practise of Pietie.</p>
                     <p>This absurd and Groundless Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie, I design'd to have taken out of the way, by Representing at large. 1st, That as long as we are here on Earth, we are in a state of penitence and banishment; That the pleasures of the World and Flesh, do not agree to such a state, because as they were the Occasions and Causes of our ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, so they are hinderances to our return to our Native Country, and consequently that Penitents and Exiles, ought not to desire them, but rather keep at a distance from them. 2d, That so much, even of these as is necessary for Travellers and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes is allowed us, so much, I say,
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:104909:464"/> as will accommodat us, not Clogg and burden us in our Journey, and that tho we possessed the things and pleasures of the World in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, yet we should use them as Travellers, not set our hearts on them, nor please our selves in them, and take for our own use, only what is simply necessary. 3d, That tho the Life of a Christian were a state of Pure and continual Miseries, as most certainly it is not, yet this lastes but for a litle time, and the Joys of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie, for fuller Measures, and a more grateful relish whereof, great afflictions and sufferings do without doubt prepare us, will infinitly make up these short Liv'd, and seeming disadvantages. 4th, That all the Exercises of the Christian Life, even these which seem more mournful and afflicting, such as <hi>Self-denyal, bearing the Cross, Contrition, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeing the Old Man,</hi> and the like, have pleasure inseparably annexed to
<pb n="814" facs="tcp:104909:465"/> them, which the Holy Scriptures and the Experience of the Saints do abundantly verifie. That love being the Principle of this blessed Life, Sweetens, and Recommends, and gives a Savory relish to every thing in it. And that though a good Soul may for some time be under great desolations, yet as there is an inward Serenity of mind that accompanies him, and a secret force that supports him, while he is in this state, so his long and great Tribulations prove a certain introduction to, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for a state of full and solid, and Peremanent joys; as sharp and trying and uneasie Medicines, issue at last in a perfect health, and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the patient in the mean time, is enabled to bear them by the secret intermingling of some things that are Cordial. 5th, That when in our Christian course, we meet with any thing that is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, Harsh, and Painfull, this is
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:104909:465"/> owing, not to Religion which origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally required nothing off us but Love, but to the disorders and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers of our Minds, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out evident hazard of relapsing, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admitt of an easier cure. 6. That a sincere Christian nauseats the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and delights of the world and flesh, knowing that they are certain hinderances to his Perfection and Happiness; And therefore, that being deprived of them, can be no miserie to him. Such a deprivation is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie only to carnal and earthly hearts, who love the world and the things of the world, and are so sunk into flesh, that nothing goes well away with them, but what savours of it. 7. That our holy Religion obliges us to disclaime and abandon nothing but what is really hurtful and disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous unto us, and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is our Interest readily to forgo. 8. That how uneasie and disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able soever the Christian Life may
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:104909:466"/> appear to us, yet since now our Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deemer hath ratified it by his Precept and Example, and assured us that it is the only way to Happiness, and since all his faithful Followers have travelled in it, we should make no demu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e to enter on it, if we intend to arrive at Eternal Life. 9. That it is our flesh and self-love and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that resent and murmur at the Christian Life, as if it were too strict and severe. But that it is not from these that we ought to take our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. in determining what is good and profitable for us, that this would be as improper, as to set up a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verish and distempered palat to be the Standard whereby to judge of the Goodness and wholsomeness of Meats and Drinks. 10. That Religion was intended for the Cure and Redress of our lapsed natures, and that it is not possible, as things now stand, that what is diseased and out of order in us, should be healed and set right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again,
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:104909:466"/> without our feeling some smart and trouble; And therefore, that to be frightened from the Practice of Piety, because of some Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that necessarly attend our Cure, not only bewrays a base and mean, soft and cowardly Spirit, but also is a sign that one is in love with his miseries, and is desperatly resolved rather to live and dy in his distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, than suffer any thing in order to have them healed. 11. That how great soever the difficulties and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easinesses to be met with in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Life may be, yet the consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Mighty Assistances, the many Consolations, the great and excellent Rewards which the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Sincere Votaries of it are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly assured of, is capable to make the prospect of its difficulties to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear and evanish in all ingenuous Hearts. That the Strictnesses and Severities of Religion ought not to be viewed absolutely and in themselves,
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:104909:467"/> but as they are attended with graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Supports and Cordials, and as certainly leading to and issuing in Peace and Purity, Perfection, Glory, and Eternal Life. As a Patient who is afflicted with a great many diseas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ought not to consider the Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Purges, and Launces and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Instruments and Medicines, that must be imployed in effectuating his Cure <hi>simply</hi> in themselves, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further reguard, but as they are <hi>Means</hi> to procure his Health. This would soon reconcile him to the use of them, whereas the former view might dishearten him from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them. 12. That, after all, great Prudence and Discretion must be used in the Management of young Disciples, they must be gradually acquainted with the Practices of the Christian Life. Things easie and proportion'd to their Capacities and Strength, are at first to be proposed to them. We must take care that
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:104909:467"/> we<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 9.17.</note>
                        <hi>put not new Wine in old bottles. Babes are to be fed</hi>

                        <hi>with milk not with strong meat.</hi> Our Lord would not communicat to his Disciples what<note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 16.12.</note> they were not able to bear. It would<note n="d" place="margin">1 John 2.12, 13.</note> be absurd to oblige Children to the Dutys of <hi>Young Men and Fathers:</hi> Such are to be trained up by Peice-meal to the heights of Christian Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. I am apt to think, that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Consideration of these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, even as here briefly suggested, will be sufficient both to stop the mouths of such as prophanly cavil, and would make others bogle at the Accounts we have given of our Holy Religion, as if it were too strict and severe, and wholly constitute of sad and gloomie thoughts; And to evince that it's native Tendencies are to remove the true causes of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> to introduce a solid Peace and Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity into our <hi>Minds,</hi> and to prevent these black and dispairing apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, these direful agonies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:104909:468"/> of <hi>Soul,</hi> that will at long-run be the necessarie Issue and Result of a dissolute, vitious and debauched life. And this was to shut up all I intended to say of the example of our Redeemer, which how accommodat it is to carry on the Designs of the Incarnation, needs not be any further declared, the thing being so very plain and evident of it self.</p>
                     <p>The fourth and last Mean which he imployes for this same end, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yl, <hi>Efficacie and Power,</hi> would in the next place have fallen under our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration thus, as the Reader can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but observe, runs through the other three, and though from what is already delivered concerning it, we cannot be altogether at a lose how to think of it; Yet because of its moment and importance, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to have been treated of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and by it self.</p>
                     <p>After this I was to resume the <hi>Life,</hi> and more especially, the <hi>Sufferings</hi>
                        <pb n="821" facs="tcp:104909:468"/> and <hi>Death</hi> of our Blessed Saviour, and to have viewed them as they are a <hi>Source</hi> of infinite Merits, <hi>as excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Instructions of Devotion, as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Love and Obedience,</hi> as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements</hi> to <hi>Penitential Sorrowing</hi> and <hi>Hatred of all Sin,</hi> as sure and certain <hi>Grounds</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> and as <hi>Unfailing Springs</hi> of <hi>Manifold Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to all <hi>Sincere Christians</hi> in all <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Conditions.</hi> And then would have followed the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Ascenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as they are Pledges and Assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ours, and a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>laration of the <hi>Impressions which they ought to have n us as such.</hi> And finally, The whole of what concerned <hi>the Mystery of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation</hi> was to be shut up in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our <hi>Redeemer's sitting on the Right Hand of GOD, and his coming in Glory to Judge the World,</hi> and of the Duties by which we ought to correspond to these great Articles of our Faith.</p>
                     <pb n="822" facs="tcp:104909:469"/>
                     <p>And then, in pursuance of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, I was to proceed to give my remaining Advices; Such as, That great Care be taken, in these times of Error and wavering, <hi>To confirm the Youth in the Truth of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, where I was to direct unto the best Methods of doing this;</hi> And, by the way, to enquire into the Causes and Grounds of the present Growth of <hi>Deism</hi> and the contempt that is put on <hi>Reveal'd Religion.</hi> And next, That they be brought into an early Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with their Souls, and told that their Bodie is but an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Tabernacle, that lodges an Immortal Inhabitant, which hath Noble Faculties, and great and vast Capacities. That this is their Better Part, and that their chief Care should be to get its disorders Redressed, and its filthiness and rubbish done away; And so to dress and prepare it for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining that Glorious and Infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perfect Beeing, for whom it was
<pb n="823" facs="tcp:104909:469"/>
                        <hi>Originally design'd as his Living Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> in which he ought to be Lov'd and Ador'd, and where also he would manifest his Power and Glorie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat his Sweetness, and diffuse his Light and Joyes, and continue so doing, not only without Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Diminution, but with Increase of Delights, and new Discoveries of Adorable Beauties throughout all Eternity. And in fine, That they be informed that there is <hi>A Wise &amp; Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, a Just and Righteous, a Good and Holy Providence, that Governs the World, whereof Just Notions ought to be given them:</hi> And some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Instances, wherein it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably interposed, set before them; and the Duties to which the Belief of it obliges, deduced and inculcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them.</p>
                     <p>But the full Prosecution of these and other things must be reserved for another Occasion. In the mean time, I am hopeful that such a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="824" facs="tcp:104909:470"/> is already laid down, as wil naturally and easily lead to erect the Superstructure, tho no further Instructions were given; I have tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en my Rise from the very first Point, and guided such, as will incline to follow, thrô a good part of the way, so that no well disposed and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Person, can dangerously mistake in what remains of it.</p>
                     <p>They are not triffles and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties that I have insisted on, but great &amp; excellent Things, and of vast Consequence; And I perswade my self, that whoever Seriously per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uses, and Solidly Digests the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> afforded, will soon be sensible how accommodat and well suited they are, to form Young Hearts, and to conduct them to the most Eminent Instances of Christian Piety. I shall only add my hearty Prayers to the <hi>Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> that he would effectually Bless this Performance, that he would
<pb n="825" facs="tcp:104909:470"/> dispose such whose Province it is to <hi>Educat the Youth,</hi> to manage that Great Trust, according to these or the like Measures, and Countenance and give Success to their Pious Care and Diligence, that the Good and Edification of Souls may be happily promoved by our joynt Endeavours, And the Glory of all may Redound to His ever Blessed and Adoreable Name, AMEN.</p>
